# Not much too say

I just wanted to see if Gemini2.5 Pro could do a more bro-friendly of a book I like.

Then I happened to find the result interesting.

I used this translation for the Enchiridion: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/45109/45109-h/45109-h.htm

The full history of the conversation with the Gemini is in the repository.

Overleaf has been used to produce the pdf and https://pandoc.org/try/ for the markdown in the Readme.

To anyone thinking this project should not exist, please reconsider these points before making your judgment: 

- Our old teachers were more about getting their practice right than anything else.

- They were not ashamed to ask for help in the interpretation of difficult work.

- Their discourse was straight to the point.
