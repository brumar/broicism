      "text": "I am doing \"bro versions\" of classic stoic texts. Check this first work and reproduce it with my new target.\noriginal :\nSaunders, Jason L., Justus Lipsius. The Philosophy of Renaissance Stoicism. New York, 1955.\nWenley, R. M., Stoicism and Its Influence. New York, 1927.\nTHE ENCHIRIDION\nI\nThere are things which are within our power, and there are things which are beyond our power. Within our power are opinion, aim, desire, aversion, and, in one word, whatever affairs are our own. Beyond our power are body, property, reputation, office, and, in one word, whatever are not properly our own affairs.\nNow the things within our power are by nature free, unrestricted, unhindered; but those beyond our power are weak, dependent, restricted, alien. Remember, then, that if you attribute freedom to things by nature dependent and take what belongs to others for your own, you will be hindered, you will lament, you will be disturbed, you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you take for your own only that which is your own and view what belongs to others just as it really is, then no one will ever compel you, no one will restrict you; you will find fault with no one, you will accuse no one, you will do nothing against your will; no one will hurt you, you will not have an enemy, nor will you suffer any harm.\nAiming, therefore, at such great things, remember that you must not allow yourself any inclination, however slight, toward the attainment of the others; but that you must entirely quit some of them, and for the present postpone the rest. But if you would have these, and possess power and wealth likewise, you may miss the latter in seeking the former; and you will certainly fail of that by which alone happiness and freedom are procured.\nSeek at once, therefore, to be able to say to every unpleasing semblance, “You are but a semblance and by no means the real thing.” And then examine it by those rules which you have; and first and chiefly by this: whether it concerns the things which are within our own power or those which are not; and if it concerns anything beyond our power, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.\nII\nRemember that desire demands the attainment of that of which you are desirous; and aversion demands the avoidance of that to which you are averse; that he who fails of the object of his desires is disappointed; and he who incurs the object of his aversion is wretched. If, then, you shun only those undesirable things which you can control, you will never incur anything which you shun; but if you shun sickness, or death, or poverty, you will run the risk of wretchedness. Remove [the habit of] aversion, then, from all things that are not within our power, and apply it to things undesirable which are within our power. But for the present, altogether restrain desire; for if you desire any of the things not within our own power, you must necessarily be disappointed; and you are not yet secure of those which are within our power, and so are legitimate objects of desire. Where it is practically necessary for you to pursue or avoid anything, do even this with discretion and gentleness and moderation.\nIII\nWith regard to whatever objects either delight the mind or contribute to use or are tenderly beloved, remind yourself of what nature they are, beginning with the merest trifles: if you have a favorite cup, that it is but a cup of which you are fond of—for thus, if it is broken, you can bear it; if you embrace your child or your wife, that you embrace a mortal—and thus, if either of them dies, you can bear it.\nIV\nWhen you set about any action, remind yourself of what nature the action is. If you are going to bathe, represent to yourself the incidents usual in the bath—some persons pouring out, others pushing in, others scolding, others pilfering. And thus you will more safely go about this action if you say to yourself, “I will now go to bathe and keep my own will in harmony with nature.” And so with regard to every other action. For thus, if any impediment arises in bathing, you will be able to say, “It was not only to bathe that I desired, but to keep my will in harmony with nature; and I shall not keep it thus if I am out of humor at things that happen.”\nV\nMen are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things. Thus death is nothing terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death, that it is terrible. When, therefore, we are hindered or disturbed, or grieved, let us never impute it to others, but to ourselves—that is, to our own views. It is the action of an uninstructed person to reproach others for his own misfortunes; of one entering upon instruction, to reproach himself; and one perfectly instructed, to reproach neither others nor himself.\nVI\nBe not elated at any excellence not your own. If a horse should be elated, and say, “I am handsome,” it might be endurable. But when you are elated and say, “I have a handsome horse,” know that you are elated only on the merit of the horse. What then is your own? The use of the phenomena of existence. So that when you are in harmony with nature in this respect, you will be elated with some reason; for you will be elated at some good of your own.\nVII\nAs in a voyage, when the ship is at anchor, if you go on shore to get water, you may amuse yourself with picking up a shellfish or a truffle in your way, but your thoughts ought to be bent toward the ship, and perpetually attentive, lest the captain should call, and then you must leave all these things, that you may not have to be carried on board the vessel, bound like a sheep; thus likewise in life, if, instead of a truffle or shellfish, such a thing as a wife or a child be granted you, there is no objection; but if the captain calls, run to the ship, leave all these things, and never look behind. But if you are old, never go far from the ship, lest you should be missing when called for.\nVIII\nDemand not that events should happen as you wish; but wish them to happen as they do happen, and you will go on well.\nIX\nSickness is an impediment to the body, but not to the will unless itself pleases. Lameness is an impediment to the leg, but not to the will; and say this to yourself with regard to everything that happens. For you will find it to be an impediment to something else, but not truly to yourself.\nX\nUpon every accident, remember to turn toward yourself and inquire what faculty you have for its use. If you encounter a handsome person, you will find continence the faculty needed; if pain, then fortitude; if reviling, then patience. And when thus habituated, the phenomena of existence will not overwhelm you.\nXI\nNever say of anything, “I have lost it,” but, “I have restored it.” Has your child died? It is restored. Has your wife died? She is restored. Has your estate been taken away? That likewise is restored. “But it was a bad man who took it.” What is it to you by whose hands he who gave it has demanded it again? While he permits you to possess it, hold it as something not your own, as do travelers at an inn.\nXII\nIf you would improve, lay aside such reasonings as these: “If I neglect my affairs, I shall not have a maintenance; if I do not punish my servant, he will be good for nothing.” For it were better to die of hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better that your servant should be bad than you unhappy.\nBegin therefore with little things. Is a little oil spilled or a little wine stolen? Say to yourself, “This is the price paid for peace and tranquillity; and nothing is to be had for nothing.” And when you call your servant, consider that it is possible he may not come at your call; or, if he does, that he may not do what you wish. But it is not at all desirable for him, and very undesirable for you, that it should be in his power to cause you any disturbance.\nXIII\nIf you would improve, be content to be thought foolish and dull with regard to externals. Do not desire to be thought to know anything; and though you should appear to others to be somebody, distrust yourself. For be assured, it is not easy at once to keep your will in harmony with nature and to secure externals; but while you are absorbed in the one, you must of necessity neglect the other.\nXIV\nIf you wish your children and your wife and your friends to live forever, you are foolish, for you wish things to be in your power which are not so, and what belongs to others to be your own. So likewise, if you wish your servant to be without fault, you are foolish, for you wish vice not to be vice but something else. But if you wish not to be disappointed in your desires, that is in your own power. Exercise, therefore, what is in your power. A man’s master is he who is able to confer or remove whatever that man seeks or shuns. Whoever then would be free, let him wish nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on others; else he must necessarily be a slave.\nXV\nRemember that you must behave as at a banquet. Is anything brought round to you? Put out your hand and take a moderate share. Does it pass by you? Do not stop it. Is it not yet come? Do not yearn in desire toward it, but wait till it reaches you. So with regard to children, wife, office, riches; and you will some time or other be worthy to feast with the gods. And if you do not so much as take the things which are set before you, but are able even to forego them, then you will not only be worthy to feast with the gods, but to rule with them also. For, by thus doing, Diogenes and Heraclitus, and others like them, deservedly became divine, and were so recognized.\nXVI\nWhen you see anyone weeping for grief, either that his son has gone abroad or that he has suffered in his affairs, take care not to be overcome by the apparent evil, but discriminate and be ready to say, “What hurts this man is not this occurrence itself—for another man might not be hurt by it—but the view he chooses to take of it.” As far as conversation goes, however, do not disdain to accommodate yourself to him and, if need be, to groan with him. Take heed, however, not to groan inwardly, too.\nXVII\nRemember that you are an actor in a drama of such sort as the Author chooses—if short, then in a short one; if long, then in a long one. If it be his pleasure that you should enact a poor man, or a cripple, or a ruler, or a private citizen, see that you act it well. For this is your business—to act well the given part, but to choose it belongs to another.\nXVIII\nWhen a raven happens to croak unluckily, be not overcome by appearances, but discriminate and say, “Nothing is portended to me, either to my paltry body, or property, or reputation, or children, or wife. But to me all portents are lucky if I will. For whatsoever happens, it belongs to me to derive advantage therefrom.”\nXIX\nYou can be unconquerable if you enter into no combat in which it is not in your own power to conquer. When, therefore, you see anyone eminent in honors or power, or in high esteem on any other account, take heed not to be bewildered by appearances and to pronounce him happy; for if the essence of good consists in things within our own power, there will be no room for envy or emulation. But, for your part, do not desire to be a general, or a senator, or a consul, but to be free; and the only way to this is a disregard of things which lie not within our own power.\nXX\nRemember that it is not he who gives abuse or blows, who affronts, but the view we take of these things as insulting. When, therefore, anyone provokes you, be assured that it is your own opinion which provokes you. Try, therefore, in the first place, not to be bewildered by appearances. For if you once gain time and respite, you will more easily command yourself.\nXXI\nLet death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible, be daily before your eyes, but death chiefly; and you will never entertain an abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything.\nXXII\nIf you have an earnest desire toward philosophy, prepare yourself from the very first to have the multitude laugh and sneer, and say, “He is returned to us a philosopher all at once”; and, “Whence this supercilious look?” Now, for your part, do not have a supercilious look indeed, but keep steadily to those things which appear best to you, as one appointed by God to this particular station. For remember that, if you are persistent, those very persons who at first ridiculed will afterwards admire you. But if you are conquered by them, you will incur a double ridicule.\nXXIII\nIf you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, for the pleasure of anyone, be assured that you have ruined your scheme of life. Be content, then, in everything, with being a philosopher; and if you wish to seem so likewise to anyone, appear so to yourself, and it will suffice you.\nXXIV\nLet not such considerations as these distress you: “I shall live in discredit and be nobody anywhere.” For if discredit be an evil, you can no more be involved in evil through another than in baseness. Is it any business of yours, then, to get power or to be admitted to an entertainment? By no means. How then, after all, is this discredit? And how it is true that you will be nobody anywhere when you ought to be somebody in those things only which are within your own power, in which you may be of the greatest consequence? “But my friends will be unassisted.” What do you mean by “unassisted”? They will not have money from you, nor will you make them Roman citizens. Who told you, then, that these are among the things within our own power, and not rather the affairs of others? And who can give to another the things which he himself has not? “Well, but get them, then, that we too may have a share.” If I can get them with the preservation of my own honor and fidelity and self-respect, show me the way and I will get them; but if you require me to lose my own proper good, that you may gain what is no good, consider how unreasonable and foolish you are. Besides, which would you rather have, a sum of money or a faithful and honorable friend? Rather assist me, then, to gain this character than require me to do those things by which I may lose it. Well, but my country, say you, as far as depends upon me, will be unassisted. Here, again, what assistance is this you mean? It will not have porticos nor baths of your providing? And what signifies that? Why, neither does a smith provide it with shoes, nor a shoemaker with arms. It is enough if everyone fully performs his own proper business. And were you to supply it with another faithful and honorable citizen, would not he be of use to it? Yes. Therefore neither are you yourself useless to it. “What place, then,” say you, “shall I hold in the state?” Whatever you can hold with the preservation of your fidelity and honor. But if, by desiring to be useful to that, you lose these, how can you serve your country when you have become faithless and shameless?\nXXV\nIs anyone preferred before you at an entertainment, or in courtesies, or in confidential intercourse? If these things are good, you ought to rejoice that he has them; and if they are evil, do not be grieved that you have them not. And remember that you cannot be permitted to rival others in externals without using the same means to obtain them. For how can he who will not haunt the door of any man, will not attend him, will not praise him, have an equal share with him who does these things? You are unjust, then, and unreasonable if you are unwilling to pay the price for which these things are sold, and would have them for nothing. For how much are lettuces sold? An obulus, for instance. If another, then, paying an obulus, takes the lettuces, and you, not paying it, go without them, do not imagine that he has gained any advantage over you. For as he has the lettuces, so you have the obulus which you did not give. So, in the present case, you have not been invited to such a person’s entertainment because you have not paid him the price for which a supper is sold. It is sold for praise; it is sold for attendance. Give him, then, the value if it be for your advantage. But if you would at the same time not pay the one, and yet receive the other, you are unreasonable and foolish. Have you nothing, then, in place of the supper? Yes, indeed, you have—not to praise him whom you do not like to praise; not to bear the insolence of his lackeys.\nXXVI\nThe will of nature may be learned from things upon which we are all agreed. As when our neighbor’s boy has broken a cup, or the like, we are ready at once to say, “These are casualties that will happen”; be assured, then, that when your own cup is likewise broken, you ought to be affected just as when another’s cup was broken. Now apply this to greater things. Is the child or wife of another dead? There is no one who would not say, “This is an accident of mortality.” But if anyone’s own child happens to die, it is immediately, “Alas! how wretched am I!” It should be always remembered how we are affected on hearing the same thing concerning others.\nXXVII\nAs a mark[1] is not set up for the sake of missing the aim, so neither does the nature of evil exist in the world.\nXXVIII\nIf a person had delivered up your body to some passer-by, you would certainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in delivering up your own mind to any reviler, to be disconcerted and confounded?\nXXIX[2]\nIn every affair consider what precedes and what follows, and then undertake it. Otherwise you will begin with spirit, indeed, careless of the consequences, and when these are developed, you will shamefully desist. “I would conquer at the Olympic Games.” But consider what precedes and what follows, and then, if it be for your advantage, engage in the affair. You must conform to rules, submit to a diet, refrain from dainties; exercise your body, whether you choose it or not, at a stated hour, in heat and cold; you must drink no cold water, and sometimes no wine—in a word, you must give yourself up to your trainer as to a physician. Then, in the combat, you may be thrown into a ditch, dislocate your arm, turn your ankle, swallow an abundance of dust, receive stripes [for negligence], and, after all, lose the victory. When you have reckoned up all this, if your inclination still holds, set about the combat. Otherwise, take notice, you will behave like children who sometimes play wrestlers, sometimes gladiators, sometimes blow a trumpet, and sometimes act a tragedy, when they happen to have seen and admired these shows. Thus you too will be at one time a wrestler, and another a gladiator; now a philosopher, now an orator; but nothing in earnest. Like an ape you mimic all you see, and one thing after another is sure to please you, but is out of favor as soon as it becomes familiar. For you have never entered upon anything considerately; nor after having surveyed and tested the whole matter, but carelessly, and with a halfway zeal. Thus some, when they have seen a philosopher and heard a man speaking like Euphrates[3]—though, indeed, who can speak like him?—have a mind to be philosophers, too. Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do you think that you can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob.\nXXX\nDuties are universally measured by relations. Is a certain man your father? In this are implied taking care of him, submitting to him in all things, patiently receiving his reproaches, his correction. But he is a bad father. Is your natural tie, then, to a good father? No, but to a father. Is a brother unjust? Well, preserve your own just relation toward him. Consider not what he does, but what you are to do to keep your own will in a state conformable to nature, for another cannot hurt you unless you please. You will then be hurt when you consent to be hurt. In this manner, therefore, if you accustom yourself to contemplate the relations of neighbor, citizen, commander, you can deduce from each the corresponding duties.\nXXXI\nBe assured that the essence of piety toward the gods lies in this—to form right opinions concerning them, as existing and as governing the universe justly and well. And fix yourself in this resolution, to obey them, and yield to them, and willingly follow them amidst all events, as being ruled by the most perfect wisdom. For thus you will never find fault with the gods, nor accuse them of neglecting you. And it is not possible for this to be affected in any other way than by withdrawing yourself from things which are not within our own power, and by making good or evil to consist only in those which are. For if you suppose any other things to be either good or evil, it is inevitable that, when you are disappointed of what you wish or incur what you would avoid, you should reproach and blame their authors. For every creature is naturally formed to flee and abhor things that appear hurtful and that which causes them; and to pursue and admire those which appear beneficial and that which causes them. It is impracticable, then, that one who supposes himself to be hurt should rejoice in the person who, as he thinks, hurts him, just as it is impossible to rejoice in the hurt itself. Hence, also, a father is reviled by his son when he does not impart the things which seem to be good; and this made Polynices and Eteocles[4] mutually enemies—that empire seemed good to both. On this account the husbandman reviles the gods; [and so do] the sailor, the merchant, or those who have lost wife or child. For where our interest is, there, too, is piety directed. So that whoever is careful to regulate his desires and aversions as he ought is thus made careful of piety likewise. But it also becomes incumbent on everyone to offer libations and sacrifices and first fruits, according to the customs of his country, purely, and not heedlessly nor negligently; not avariciously, nor yet extravagantly.\nXXXII\nWhen you have recourse to divination, remember that you know not what the event will be, and you come to learn it of the diviner; but of what nature it is you knew before coming; at least, if you are of philosophic mind. For if it is among the things not within our own power, it can by no means be either good or evil. Do not, therefore, bring with you to the diviner either desire or aversion—else you will approach him trembling—but first clearly understand that every event is indifferent and nothing to you, of whatever sort it may be; for it will be in your power to make a right use of it, and this no one can hinder. Then come with confidence to the gods as your counselors; and afterwards, when any counsel is given you, remember what counselors you have assumed, and whose advice you will neglect if you disobey. Come to divination as Socrates prescribed, in cases of which the whole consideration relates to the event, and in which no opportunities are afforded by reason or any other art to discover the matter in view. When, therefore, it is our duty to share the danger of a friend or of our country, we ought not to consult the oracle as to whether we shall share it with them or not. For though the diviner should forewarn you that the auspices are unfavorable, this means no more than that either death or mutilation or exile is portended. But we have reason within us; and it directs us, even with these hazards, to stand by our friend and our country. Attend, therefore, to the greater diviner, the Pythian God, who once cast out of the temple him who neglected to save his friend.[5]\nXXXIII\nBegin by prescribing to yourself some character and demeanor, such as you may preserve both alone and in company.\nBe mostly silent, or speak merely what is needful, and in few words. We may, however, enter sparingly into discourse sometimes, when occasion calls for it; but let it not run on any of the common subjects, as gladiators, or horse races, or athletic champions, or food, or drink—the vulgar topics of conversation—and especially not on men, so as either to blame, or praise, or make comparisons. If you are able, then, by your own conversation, bring over that of your company to proper subjects; but if you happen to find yourself among strangers, be silent.\nLet not your laughter be loud, frequent, or abundant.\nAvoid taking oaths, if possible, altogether; at any rate, so far as you are able.\nAvoid public and vulgar entertainments; but if ever an occasion calls you to them, keep your attention upon the stretch, that you may not imperceptibly slide into vulgarity. For be assured that if a person be ever so pure himself, yet, if his companion be corrupted, he who converses with him will be corrupted likewise.\nProvide things relating to the body no further than absolute need requires, as meat, drink, clothing, house, retinue. But cut off everything that looks toward show and luxury.\nBefore marriage guard yourself with all your ability from unlawful intercourse with women; yet be not uncharitable or severe to those who are led into this, nor boast frequently that you yourself do otherwise.\nIf anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not make excuses about what is said of you, but answer: “He was ignorant of my other faults, else he would not have mentioned these alone.”\nIt is not necessary for you to appear often at public spectacles; but if ever there is a proper occasion for you to be there, do not appear more solicitous for any other than for yourself—that is, wish things to be only just as they are, and only the best man to win; for thus nothing will go against you. But abstain entirely from acclamations and derision and violent emotions. And when you come away, do not discourse a great deal on what has passed and what contributes nothing to your own amendment. For it would appear by such discourse that you were dazzled by the show.\nBe not prompt or ready to attend private recitations; but if you do attend, preserve your gravity and dignity, and yet avoid making yourself disagreeable.\nWhen you are going to confer with anyone, and especially with one who seems your superior, represent to yourself how Socrates or Zeno[6] would behave in such a case, and you will not be at a loss to meet properly whatever may occur.\nWhen you are going before anyone in power, fancy to yourself that you may not find him at home, that you may be shut out, that the doors may not be opened to you, that he may not notice you. If, with all this, it be your duty to go, bear what happens and never say to yourself, “It was not worth so much”; for this is vulgar, and like a man bewildered by externals.\nIn company, avoid a frequent and excessive mention of your own actions and dangers. For however agreeable it may be to yourself to allude to the risks you have run, it is not equally agreeable to others to hear your adventures. Avoid likewise an endeavor to excite laughter, for this may readily slide you into vulgarity, and, besides, may be apt to lower you in the esteem of your acquaintance. Approaches to indecent discourse are likewise dangerous. Therefore, when anything of this sort happens, use the first fit opportunity to rebuke him who makes advances that way, or, at least, by silence and blushing and a serious look show yourself to be displeased by such talk.\nXXXIV\nIf you are dazzled by the semblance of any promised pleasure, guard yourself against being bewildered by it; but let the affair wait your leisure, and procure yourself some delay. Then bring to your mind both points of time—that in which you shall enjoy the pleasure, and that in which you will repent and reproach yourself, after you have enjoyed it—and set before you, in opposition to these, how you will rejoice and applaud yourself if you abstain. And even though it should appear to you a seasonable gratification, take heed that its enticements and allurements and seductions may not subdue you, but set in opposition to this how much better it is to be conscious of having gained so great a victory.\nXXXV\nWhen you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought to be done, never shrink from being seen to do it, even though the world should misunderstand it; for if you are not acting rightly, shun the action itself; if you are, why fear those who wrongly censure you?\nXXXVI\nAs the proposition, “either it is day or it is night,” has much force in a disjunctive argument, but none at all in a conjunctive one, so, at a feast, to choose the largest share is very suitable to the bodily appetite, but utterly inconsistent with the social spirit of the entertainment. Remember, then, when you eat with another, not only the value to the body of those things which are set before you, but also the value of proper courtesy toward your host.\nXXXVII\nIf you have assumed any character beyond your strength, you have both demeaned yourself ill in that and quitted one which you might have supported.\nXXXVIII\nAs in walking you take care not to tread upon a nail, or turn your foot, so likewise take care not to hurt the ruling faculty of your mind. And if we were to guard against this in every action, we should enter upon action more safely.\nXXXIX\nThe body is to everyone the proper measure of its possessions, as the foot is of the shoe. If, therefore, you stop at this, you will keep the measure; but if you move beyond it, you must necessarily be carried forward, as down a precipice; as in the case of a shoe, if you go beyond its fitness to the foot, it comes first to be gilded, then purple, and then studded with jewels. For to that which once exceeds the fit measure there is no bound.\nXL\nWomen from fourteen years old are flattered by men with the title of mistresses. Therefore, perceiving that they are regarded only as qualified to give men pleasure, they begin to adorn themselves, and in that to place all their hopes. It is worth while, therefore, to try that they may perceive themselves honored only so far as they appear beautiful in their demeanor and modestly virtuous.\nXLI\nIt is a mark of want of intellect to spend much time in things relating to the body, as to be immoderate in exercises, in eating and drinking, and in the discharge of other animal functions. These things should be done incidentally and our main strength be applied to our reason.\nXLII\nWhen any person does ill by you, or speaks ill of you, remember that he acts or speaks from an impression that it is right for him to do so. Now it is not possible that he should follow what appears right to you, but only what appears so to himself. Therefore, if he judges from false appearances, he is the person hurt, since he, too, is the person deceived. For if anyone takes a true proposition to be false, the proposition is not hurt, but only the man is deceived. Setting out, then, from these principles, you will meekly bear with a person who reviles you, for you will say upon every occasion, “It seemed so to him.”\nXLIII\nEverything has two handles: one by which it may be borne, another by which it cannot. If your brother acts unjustly, do not lay hold on the affair by the handle of his injustice, for by that it cannot be borne, but rather by the opposite—that he is your brother, that he was brought up with you; and thus you will lay hold on it as it is to be borne.\nXLIV\nThese reasonings have no logical connection: “I am richer than you, therefore I am your superior.” “I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am your superior.” The true logical connection is rather this: “I am richer than you, therefore my possessions must exceed yours.” “I am more eloquent than you, therefore my style must surpass yours.” But you, after all, consist neither in property nor in style.\nXLV\nDoes anyone bathe hastily? Do not say that he does it ill, but hastily. Does anyone drink much wine? Do not say that he does ill, but that he drinks a great deal. For unless you perfectly understand his motives, how should you know if he acts ill? Thus you will not risk yielding to any appearances but such as you fully comprehend.\nXLVI\nNever proclaim yourself a philosopher, nor make much talk among the ignorant about your principles, but show them by actions. Thus, at an entertainment, do not discourse how people ought to eat, but eat as you ought. For remember that thus Socrates also universally avoided all ostentation. And when persons came to him and desired to be introduced by him to philosophers, he took them and introduced them; so well did he bear being overlooked. So if ever there should be among the ignorant any discussion of principles, be for the most part silent. For there is great danger in hastily throwing out what is undigested. And if anyone tells you that you know nothing, and you are not nettled at it, then you may be sure that you have really entered on your work. For sheep do not hastily throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten, but, inwardly digesting their food, they produce it outwardly in wool and milk. Thus, therefore, do you not make an exhibition before the ignorant of your principles, but of the actions to which their digestion gives rise.\nXLVII\nWhen you have learned to nourish your body frugally, do not pique yourself upon it; nor, if you drink water, be saying upon every occasion, “I drink water.” But first consider how much more frugal are the poor than we, and how much more patient of hardship. If at any time you would inure yourself by exercise to labor and privation, for your own sake and not for the public, do not attempt great feats; but when you are violently thirsty, just rinse your mouth with water, and tell nobody.\nXLVIII\nThe condition and characteristic of a vulgar person is that he never looks for either help or harm from himself, but only from externals. The condition and characteristic of a philosopher is that he looks to himself for all help or harm. The marks of a proficient are that he censures no one, praises no one, blames no one, accuses no one; says nothing concerning himself as being anybody or knowing anything. When he is in any instance hindered or restrained, he accuses himself; and if he is praised, he smiles to himself at the person who praises him; and if he is censured, he makes no defense. But he goes about with the caution of a convalescent, careful of interference with anything that is doing well but not yet quite secure. He restrains desire; he transfers his aversion to those things only which thwart the proper use of our own will; he employs his energies moderately in all directions; if he appears stupid or ignorant, he does not care; and, in a word, he keeps watch over himself as over an enemy and one in ambush.\nXLIX\nWhen anyone shows himself vain on being able to understand and interpret the works of Chrysippus,[7] say to yourself: “Unless Chrysippus had written obscurely, this person would have had nothing to be vain of. But what do I desire? To understand nature, and follow her. I ask, then, who interprets her; and hearing that Chrysippus does, I have recourse to him. I do not understand his writings. I seek, therefore, one to interpret them.” So far there is nothing to value myself upon. And when I find an interpreter, what remains is to make use of his instructions. This alone is the valuable thing. But if I admire merely the interpretation, what do I become more than a grammarian, instead of a philosopher, except, indeed, that instead of Homer I interpret Chrysippus? When anyone, therefore, desires me to read Chrysippus to him, I rather blush when I cannot exhibit actions that are harmonious and consonant with his discourse.\nL\nWhatever rules you have adopted, abide by them as laws, and as if you would be impious to transgress them; and do not regard what anyone says of you, for this, after all, is no concern of yours. How long, then, will you delay to demand of yourself the noblest improvements, and in no instance to transgress the judgments of reason? You have received the philosophic principles with which you ought to be conversant; and you have been conversant with them. For what other master, then, do you wait as an excuse for this delay in self-reformation? You are no longer a boy but a grown man. If, therefore, you will be negligent and slothful, and always add procrastination to procrastination, purpose to purpose, and fix day after day in which you will attend to yourself, you will insensibly continue to accomplish nothing and, living and dying, remain of vulgar mind. This instant, then, think yourself worthy of living as a man grown up and a proficient. Let whatever appears to be the best be to you an inviolable law. And if any instance of pain or pleasure, glory or disgrace, be set before you, remember that now is the combat, now the Olympiad comes on, nor can it be put off; and that by one failure and defeat honor may be lost or—won. Thus Socrates became perfect, improving himself by everything, following reason alone. And though you are not yet a Socrates, you ought, however, to live as one seeking to be a Socrates.\nLI\nThe first and most necessary topic in philosophy is the practical application of principles, as, We ought not to lie; the second is that of demonstrations as, Why it is that we ought not to lie; the third, that which gives strength and logical connection to the other two, as, Why this is a demonstration. For what is demonstration? What is a consequence? What a contradiction? What truth? What falsehood? The third point is then necessary on account of the second; and the second on account of the first. But the most necessary, and that whereon we ought to rest, is the first. But we do just the contrary. For we spend all our time on the third point and employ all our diligence about that, and entirely neglect the first. Therefore, at the same time that we lie, we are very ready to show how it is demonstrated that lying is wrong.\nUpon all occasions we ought to have these maxims ready at hand:\nConduct me, Zeus, and thou, O Destiny,\nWherever your decrees have fixed my lot.\nI follow cheerfully; and, did I not,\nWicked and wretched, I must follow still.[8]\nWho’er yields properly to Fate is deemed\nWise among men, and knows the laws of Heaven.[9]\nAnd this third:\n“O Crito, if it thus pleases the gods, thus let it be.”[10] “Anytus and Melitus may kill me indeed; but hurt me they cannot.”[11]\nNOW THE TRANSLATION\nKnow What You Control (And What You Don’t)\nLife’s simple, really. There’s stuff you control, and stuff you don’t.\nWhat you do control: your opinions, your goals, what you chase, what\nyou avoid – basically, your thoughts and actions. Your inner game. What\nyou don’t control: your body (beyond basic upkeep), your stuff (car,\ncash), your reputation (what others think), your job title – basically,\nanything outside your own choices. The external stuff is shaky ground.\nTrying to force it is like yelling at the rain. If you mistake external\nthings (like someone else’s opinion) as essential for your happiness,\nyou’re setting yourself up for frustration, blame games, and stress.\nFocus only on mastering your game – your thoughts, choices, reactions.\nAccept external stuff for what it is: things that happen, but don’t\ndefine you. Do that, and no one can truly mess with your peace of mind.\nYou won’t feel powerless, you won’t blame others, you won’t act against\nyour better judgment. Your inner self stays strong.\nMaster Your Wants and Don’t Wants\nWanting things outside your control sets you up for disappointment.\nDesperately trying to avoid things outside your control (criticism,\nsetbacks, getting sick) makes you miserable when they happen. Smart\nmove: Stop trying to dodge external negatives you can’t guarantee\navoiding. Focus your avoidance only on inner screw-ups: making bad\njudgments, acting cowardly, giving in to weakness. As for desires? Dial\nback the desperate need for external wins for now. Focus on mastering\nyour inner world first. When you do need to pursue external goals\n(job, relationship), do it with purpose, but keep your cool regardless\nof the outcome.\nSee Things As They Really Are\nThat thing you love – phone, car, even a relationship? Remind yourself\nwhat it actually is. Your favorite gadget? It’s plastic and circuits,\nit can break. Your relationship? It involves mortal, flawed humans. This\nisn’t being negative; it’s being realistic. Acknowledging the temporary\nor fragile nature of things prepares you. If things change or break, you\ncan handle it with strength, not devastation.\nMentally Rehearse for Annoyances\nGoing to the gym? Expect crowds, maybe someone annoying. Driving? Expect\ntraffic. Meeting? Expect potential disagreements. Picture the likely\nfrustrations before they happen. Why? So you can decide now to\nhandle them well. Tell yourself: \"My goal isn’t just the\nworkout/drive/meeting, it’s also to keep my cool and act according to my\nprinciples.\" If annoyances pop up, you’re ready: \"Getting pissed wasn’t\nthe plan. Staying rational was.\"\nIt’s Your Reaction, Not the Event\nEvents themselves don’t upset you. Your judgment about the event does.\nA job rejection isn’t inherently terrible; the terror comes from your\nbelief that it’s terrible. When you feel blocked, stressed, or hurt,\ndon’t blame people or circumstances. Blame your interpretation. The\nrookie blames others. The guy learning blames himself too harshly. The\nguy who gets it realizes the issue is his judgment, and works on that.\nDon’t Ride on Borrowed Glory\nDon’t get puffed up about things that aren’t really yours. Bragging\n\"My car is fast\" or \"My team won\" is getting excited about the car’s\nengineering or the team’s effort, not your core worth. What is truly\nyours? How you use what life gives you – your choices, your actions,\nyour character. When you act with courage, wisdom, and integrity?\nThat’s when you earn the right to feel genuine pride. You’re proud of\nsomething undeniably your own.\nStay Focused on the Main Mission\nThink of life like an important project or deployment. You might get\nside-tracked by cool opportunities or enjoyable distractions along the\nway. Enjoy them, but always keep the main mission in mind. Be ready to\ndrop the distractions when duty calls, when priorities shift, or when\nmajor life changes happen. Don’t get so lost in the side quests\n(possessions, fleeting pleasures, even relationships if they conflict\nwith core duties) that you forget your primary objective or aren’t ready\nfor the inevitable call to move on or face reality. If you’re getting\nolder, stay even more focused – the final call could come anytime.\nWant What Is, Not What You Wish\nStop wishing life would perfectly match your desires. That’s a direct\npath to frustration. Instead, learn to want things to happen exactly\nas they do happen. Align your will with reality. Master this, and\nyou’ll navigate life much more smoothly.\nObstacles Are External, Not Core\nGetting injured? That limits your body, but only limits your will if\nyou let it. A setback at work blocks that project, but doesn’t block\nyour will to adapt, learn, and persevere. Apply this everywhere.\nSetbacks hinder something else, not you—your essential self—unless\nyou give them permission by surrendering your judgment.\nKnow Your Inner Toolkit\nFacing a challenge? Ask yourself: \"What inner tool do I have for this?\"\nTempted by something you know is wrong? Tool: Self-control. Facing\nhardship? Tool: Endurance. Dealing with insults? Tool: Patience.\nPractice identifying and using the right inner tool, and external stuff\nloses its power to knock you down.\nThink \"Returned,\" Not \"Lost\"\nNever say \"I lost it.\" Think \"I returned it.\" Relationship ended?\nReturned. Lost money? Returned. Job gone? Returned. \"But it was unfair\nhow it happened!\" Does the method of return change the fact that\nnothing external was ever permanently yours? While life lets you have\nsomething, treat it like borrowed equipment – appreciate it, use it\nwell, but know it’s on loan.\nPeace Over Agitated Wealth\nStop agonizing: \"If I don’t constantly grind, I’ll fail!\" or \"If I don’t\nmicromanage everyone, they’ll screw up!\" Seriously, it’s better to face\nstruggles with inner calm than to be rich but constantly stressed and\nanxious. It’s better for your team to be imperfect than for you to be\nmiserable trying to force their perfection. Start small. Minor screw-up\nhappens? Tell yourself, \"Small price for keeping my cool.\" Someone\ndoesn’t respond instantly? Their actions are theirs. Don’t give them the\npower to ruin your peace.\nBe Okay Looking ’Clueless’ on Externals\nIf you’re serious about inner strength, accept you might seem out of\ntouch with trends, gossip, or status games. Don’t feel pressured to know\neverything external. Even if others see you as ’important,’ stay\nskeptical of that image. You can’t easily max out your inner game and\nthe external status game simultaneously. Focusing hard on one means less\nfocus on the other. Choose wisely.\nTrue Freedom is Wanting Only What You Control\nWishing things you can’t control were different (people living forever,\nfriends never failing you, markets always going up) is foolish and\nguarantees pain. You’re wanting reality to bend to your will. Wanting\nnot to be disappointed? That is in your power. How? Focus your\ndesires on what you do control: your choices, your efforts, your\nintegrity. Whoever controls what you desperately crave or fear is your\nmaster. Want freedom? Stop needing things that depend on others or luck.\nOtherwise, you’re choosing slavery to circumstance.\nHandle Opportunities with Class\nThink of life offering opportunities like food at a gathering (not a\nstuffy banquet, maybe just a buffet or network event). Something good\ncomes your way (a job lead, a chance to connect)? Take a reasonable\nshare politely. Does it pass you by? Don’t grab at it desperately or\ncomplain. Hasn’t arrived yet? Don’t stare hungrily; wait patiently.\nApply this to career, relationships, money. Handle them with moderation\nwhen available, detachment when not. Better yet, develop the strength to\npolitely decline things you don’t truly need, even if offered. That\nshows real power – the strength of self-sufficiency.\nOffer Support Without Catching the Panic\nSee someone genuinely upset? Offer support. Listen. Show empathy. But\ninternally, hold onto your rational perspective. Remind yourself: \"The\nevent isn’t the core problem; their judgment about the event is\ncausing the deep pain.\" Be compassionate outwardly, but don’t let their\npanic infect your own mind. Don’t groan inwardly.\nPlay Your Assigned Role Well\nLife casts you in a role. Maybe it’s challenging, maybe it seems minor,\nmaybe it’s prominent. Your job isn’t to complain about the casting. Your\njob is to play the role you’ve been given to the absolute best of your\nability, with skill and integrity. Choosing the role isn’t up to you;\nplaying it excellently is.\nSigns Mean What You Decide They Mean\nBad news? Weird coincidence? Feeling ’unlucky’? Don’t get spooked by\nsuperficial signs. Analyze: \"This external thing says nothing definitive\nabout my core self.\" Adopt this mindset: \"Any event can be a ’good\nsign’ for me if I choose to use it well – to practice patience,\ncourage, learning, adaptation.\" You decide the meaning by how you\nrespond.\nYou’re Unbeatable If You Only Fight Winnable Battles\nWant to guarantee you’re never truly defeated? Only enter contests where\nwinning depends solely on you. That means focusing on internal battles\nof character, not external competitions for status. See someone with\nimmense power, fame, or accolades? Don’t automatically assume they’re\n’happy’ or ’winning’ at life. If true Good lies in our choices (which we\ncontrol), then envy makes no sense. Your goal isn’t to be CEO or famous.\nYour goal is freedom. The only path? Disregard things not in your\ncontrol.\nInsults Need Your Agreement to Hurt\nSomeone insults you or acts aggressively? That person isn’t the source\nof the hurt. Your decision to view their words/actions as insulting\nis. When provoked, realize: your opinion is provoking you. First\nstep: Pause. Don’t get instantly swept away. Gain a moment of breathing\nroom, and you’ll find it much easier to stay in command of yourself.\nKeep Mortality and Hardship in Mind\nRegularly contemplate the tough realities: loss, failure, pain, and\nespecially death. Keep them visible in your mind’s eye. This isn’t\nmorbid; it’s grounding. It strips away petty fears, stops you from\ndesperately clinging to fleeting things, builds courage, and clarifies\nwhat truly matters.\nExpect Pushback When You Improve\nCommit to living by these rules, to seriously working on yourself?\nPrepare for some people to mock you: \"Look who’s suddenly Mr. Serious,\"\nor \"Trying to be better than us?\" Don’t react by actually becoming\narrogant. Just quietly, consistently stick to the path you judge right.\nIf you persist, the mockers might eventually respect you. Cave to their\npressure? You earn double ridicule – for trying, and for failing weakly.\nDon’t Compromise Principles for Approval\nCatch yourself tweaking your actions or beliefs just to impress someone\nor fit in? Stop. You’ve just sabotaged your own integrity project. Be\ncontent simply being a person of principle. If you need validation,\nseek it from your own rational self-assessment. That’s the only\naudience that counts.\nDefine Your Worth and Contribution Correctly\nDon’t get stressed thinking: \"I’ll be overlooked, a nobody.\" Lack of\nexternal status isn’t a true evil. It’s not your core mission to chase\npower or invites. How can you be a ’nobody’ when you can be a ’somebody’\nof great consequence in the only arena that counts – your own\ncharacter? \"But I can’t help my friends/family (with\nmoney/connections)!\" Who said that kind of help defines your value?\nCan you give integrity if you sacrifice yours chasing wealth? If they\ndemand you lose your own genuine good (honor) so they can gain a\nsuperficial one (cash), that’s their flawed thinking. Better to be a\nreliable, honorable person for them than to become corrupt trying to\nprovide mere externals. Same for ’helping your country’ – being one more\ncitizen of integrity is a vital contribution. Your ’place’? Whatever\nyou can hold while keeping your honor intact.\nRecognize the ’Price’ of External Rewards\nSomeone else gets the promotion, the invite, the attention? If those\nthings were obtained virtuously, great for them. If they required\ncompromises you weren’t willing to make (flattery, sucking up, ethical\nshortcuts), then don’t be upset you didn’t get them. You can’t expect\nthe rewards without paying the ’price’. These things are often ’sold’\nfor a certain kind of behavior. If you’re unwilling to pay that price,\ndon’t demand the goods for free. You didn’t get the invite? Fine. What\ndid you get instead? The freedom of not having to kiss ass, the\nrelief of not praising someone you don’t respect, the integrity of\nstaying true to yourself. That has value too.\nUniversal Rules Apply to You, Too\nWhen your neighbor’s car gets dented, you think, \"Unlucky, but stuff\nhappens.\" When your car gets dented, you lose your mind. Why the\ndifference? Learn to apply the same objective standard to yourself that\nyou naturally apply to others. Hear about someone else facing a common\nhardship? Note your reaction (\"That’s tough, a part of life\"). When it\nhappens to you, recall that reaction and strive for the same rational\nacceptance.\nReality Isn’t Designed for Failure\nJust like a target isn’t set up hoping you’ll miss, the universe\nwasn’t fundamentally designed with ’evil’ or ’failure’ as its goal.\nThese arise from missing the mark – from our errors in judgment, our\nfailure to live according to reason.\nGuard Your Mind Fiercely\nYou’d be furious if someone physically restrained you or messed with\nyour body without permission. So why do you casually hand over your\nmind to any random person who insults you online or criticizes you?\nWhy let their words instantly hijack your inner state? Protect your\nmental space more fiercely than your property.\nCount the Cost Before Committing\nBefore jumping into any big endeavor (a tough project, intense training,\na major life change), seriously consider the prep work, the sacrifices,\nthe potential difficulties, and the long-term consequences. Don’t just\nleap in on pure enthusiasm. Understand the full scope – the grind, the\ndiscipline, the risk of failure. Weigh it honestly against your capacity\nand commitment. Then decide. Otherwise, you’ll start strong and quit\nwhen it gets real, looking foolish. Decide if you’re willing to pay the\nfull price for serenity and strength – which often involves less\ncomfort, less external validation, more discipline. Choose one path:\ncultivate your reason and character, or chase externals like everyone\nelse. You can’t be both half-heartedly.\nYour Duties Flow From Your Roles\nYour responsibilities are defined by your relationships. Father? Implies\ncare, respect, patience. Brother? Implies loyalty, fairness from your\nend. Boss? Implies leadership, responsibility. Employee? Implies\ndiligence, respect. \"But they’re a bad father/brother/boss!\" Your duty\nisn’t tied to their perfection; it’s tied to the role. Focus on\nfulfilling your side of the relationship virtuously, according to\nreason. Don’t let their actions dictate your integrity. Remember, you’re\nonly hurt if you consent to the idea of being hurt by judging their\nactions as harmful to your core self.\nReal Respect for Reality: Right Judgment \u0026 Acceptance\nTrue respect for the way things are (the Universe, Nature, Reality)\nmeans holding correct beliefs: understanding that the world operates by\ncause and effect, and striving to live in harmony with that reality.\nCommit to obeying this natural order, accepting what happens without\ncomplaint, trusting that even difficulties can be navigated wisely.\nYou’ll never find fault with reality itself if you stop demanding it\ncater to your whims, and locate good/evil only in your own choices. If\nyou pin your hopes on externals, you’re guaranteed to feel betrayed or\nneglected when things don’t go your way. Carefully manage your desires\n(aim for virtue) and aversions (avoid vice), and your ’piety’ or respect\nfor reality will follow. (Traditional rituals, if practiced, should be\ndone respectfully and moderately).\nSeeking Guidance (From Experts or ’Fate’)\nWhen seeking advice about an uncertain future (from a mentor, data, or\neven just contemplating probabilities), remember: you don’t know the\nspecific outcome. But you should know its nature if it’s external:\nit’s neither truly good nor truly evil for your core self. Don’t\napproach seeking guidance full of desperate hope or fear. Understand\nfirst: any external event is neutral to you because you always have\nthe power to respond wisely. Approach with confidence, ready to use\nwhatever comes. When clear duty requires facing risk (defending a\nfriend, taking a necessary business risk), don’t seek guidance on\nwhether to do it. Reason already tells you. Potential negative\noutcomes (loss, failure, pain) don’t override duty. Listen to your\nrational conscience above all predictions.\nYour Personal Code of Conduct\nEstablish clear standards for yourself, for when you’re alone and with\nothers.\nTalk less, say more: Mostly silent, or speak only what’s needed,\nconcisely. Avoid constant chatter about trivial stuff (sports stats,\ngossip, food). Especially avoid judging people. Steer conversations to\nsubstance if you can; if stuck in trivia, silence is fine.\nControl reactions: Moderate laughter. Avoid unnecessary\noaths/swearing.\nChoose environments wisely: Skip trashy entertainment. If you must\nbe there, stay mentally sharp, don’t get sucked into mob mentality.\nBad company corrupts.\nNeeds, not wants: Provide for your body’s basic needs only. Cut\nluxury and showing off.\nHandle relationships ethically: Maintain integrity in\nrelationships. Don’t be harsh on others’ failings, but don’t brag\nabout your own discipline either.\nHandle criticism calmly: Someone trash-talks you? Don’t make\nexcuses. Maybe say: \"Guess they don’t know my other flaws.\"\nEvents: Attend selectively. If there, wish for the best outcome\nbased on merit, don’t get emotionally swept up. Afterwards, discuss\nlessons learned, not just surface details.\nMeetings: Prepare mentally. How would a wise person handle this?\nAnticipate hassles (delays, closed doors) – if duty requires going,\naccept what happens without complaint.\nSelf-promotion: Avoid constantly talking about yourself, your\nexploits, your risks. It bores others. Avoid trying too hard to be\nfunny – often backfires. Avoid crude talk; if others do it, show\ndisapproval silently or firmly.\nPause Before Pleasure\nTempted by a quick hit of pleasure (junk food, procrastination, risky\nclick)? Pause. Delay. Don’t get swept away. Now, picture two moments:\nenjoying it, then regretting it later. Contrast that with how you’ll\nfeel – proud, strong – if you abstain. Even if it seems harmless, weigh\nthe temporary allure against the lasting satisfaction of winning that\ninternal battle.\nAct Rightly, Openly\nIf you’ve judged an action to be right, do it. Don’t hide it, even if\nothers might misunderstand. If your judgment was wrong, don’t do the\naction. If it was right, why fear mistaken critics?\nSocial Context Matters\nIn logic, \"Either A or B\" is fine. At a shared meal, taking the biggest\npiece might satisfy hunger but breaks social rules. Remember both:\nphysical needs and social consideration. Act appropriately for the\ncontext.\nDon’t Pretend Beyond Your Abilities\nTaking on a role or project way beyond your current skill level? You’ll\nlikely fail at it and miss the chance to succeed at something you\ncould have handled. Be honest about your current capacity. Grow into\nbigger roles, don’t just fake them.\nProtect Your Mind Like Your Body\nYou watch where you step to avoid injury. Be even more careful to\nguard your mind – your reason, your judgment – from harm (bad\ninfluences, irrational thoughts, hasty conclusions). Vigilance here\nmakes every action safer.\nNeeds Have Limits, Wants Don’t\nYour body needs certain things (food, shelter), like your foot needs the\nright size shoe. Stick to meeting genuine needs, and you have a clear\nmeasure. Go beyond – chasing luxury, status symbols, excess – and you’re\non a slippery slope with no end. Once you exceed the natural measure,\ndesire becomes boundless.\nFocus on Character, Not Just Image\nSociety pushes everyone to focus on superficials – looks, wealth,\nstatus. People then pour energy into that image, hoping for respect.\nRealize this: validation based on externals is flimsy. True, lasting\nhonor comes from inner qualities: integrity, rational conduct, genuine\nconfidence (not arrogance). Focus your main effort there.\nMind First, Body Second\nSpending excessive time obsessing over the body (extreme diets, endless\nworkout tweaking, constant health anxiety) shows a lack of perspective.\nHandle physical needs efficiently, as maintenance for the tool. Your\nprimary focus and energy should go to strengthening your mind and\ncharacter.\nUnderstand Their Perspective (Even When Wrong)\nSomeone acts badly towards you? They’re acting based on their\nperception of what’s right or necessary. They can’t see it your way;\nthey only see it theirs. If their perception is flawed, they are the\nones harmed by being mistaken. Think: If someone believes 2+2\u003d5, the\nmath isn’t harmed, they are. Bearing this in mind allows you to respond\ncalmly, thinking, \"That’s how it seemed to them.\"\nGrab the Right Handle\nEverything has two handles: one that lets you carry it, one that makes\nit unbearable. Brother wrongs you? Don’t grab the \"injustice\" handle\n(unbearable). Grab the \"he’s my brother, we share history\" handle\n(bearable). Always choose the perspective that allows you to respond\nvirtuously and constructively.\nDon’t Confuse Externals with Essence\n\"I have more money, so I’m better.\" Wrong. It just means \"I have more\nmoney.\" \"I talk smoother, so I’m superior.\" Wrong. It just means \"My\nstyle is smoother.\" You are not your bank account or your speaking\nstyle. Don’t equate external advantages with core worth.\nDescribe, Don’t Rush to Judge\nSomeone acts quickly? Say they act quickly, not badly. Someone\ndrinks a lot? Say they drink a lot, not that they’re doing wrong.\nUnless you understand their full reasoning and context, how can you know\nthe true nature of their action? Stick to facts. Avoid judgment based on\nmere appearances you don’t fully grasp.\nLive Your Principles, Don’t Just Talk\nNever declare \"I follow these Rules!\" Don’t lecture others. Show it by\nyour actions. At a meal, don’t preach about healthy eating; just eat\nhealthily. Be like Socrates: he avoided showmanship. If someone says\n\"You know nothing\" and you aren’t angered, you’re likely on the right\ntrack. Sheep don’t show off undigested grass; they produce wool and\nmilk. Digest these principles internally; let your actions be the\noutward proof.\nPractice Discipline Quietly, For Yourself\nLearned some self-discipline (eating simply, exercising regularly)?\nDon’t boast. If you drink water, don’t make it a public announcement. If\nyou want to train for hardship, do it for you, not for show. Practice\nquiet mastery: severely thirsty? Rinse your mouth, spit it out, tell\nnobody.\nWhere Do You Look for Good/Bad?\nUntrained person: Looks outside – blames or credits external factors\nfor everything. Student of these rules: Looks inside – takes\nresponsibility for their judgments and choices as the source of good or\nbad. Signs of progress: Criticizes no one, praises no one excessively,\nblames no one, accuses no one. Doesn’t talk about self as important.\nTakes responsibility for setbacks. Isn’t swayed by praise or blame.\nMoves cautiously, protecting their inner progress. Manages desires and\naversions internally. Uses energy moderately. Doesn’t care about\nappearing foolish externally. Watches self like an enemy agent.\nUse Wisdom, Don’t Just Admire Its Study\nImpressive someone understands complex theories (of science, philosophy,\nfinance)? Fine. But the original thinker likely wrote complex stuff.\nWhat’s your goal? To understand reality and live well. You seek\ninterpretations to help apply the knowledge. The application is the\nonly valuable part. Admiring the interpretation itself makes you a\ncommentator, not a practitioner. Better to live consistently with one\nsimple principle than to expertly explain complex theories you don’t\npractice.\nThe Time is Now. No More Delays.\nStick to the principles you’ve rationally accepted like unbreakable\nlaws. Ignore what others say – it’s irrelevant. How much longer will you\nwait to demand the best from yourself? You have the tools. Stop making\nexcuses. You’re an adult now. Constant delay, planning to plan – that\npath leads nowhere but mediocrity. Decide now you’re worthy of living\nas a progressing adult. Let your highest reasoned judgment be your\nguide. Pain, pleasure, fame, failure – the challenge is here, the\ncontest is now. It can’t be postponed. Every moment is a chance to win\nor lose ground internally. Live like you’re striving to be your best\nself, starting this instant.\nAction First, Theory Second\nThe most crucial part of living well is doing the right thing (e.g.,\nBe honest). Second is understanding why (e.g., Why honesty matters).\nThird is analyzing the logic (e.g., How arguments for honesty work). We\nneed #2 for #1, and #3 helps #2.

The matter of the Whole is docile and adaptable, and the Reason that controls it has in its own nature no ground to create evil, for it contains no evil; nor does it create anything amiss nor is any injury done by it; and all things come into being and are accomplished according to it.\n\n2. Provided you are doing your proper work it should be indifferent to you whether you are cold or comfortably warm, whether drowsy or with sufficient sleep, whether your report is evil or good, whether you are in the act of death or doing something else. For even that wherein we die is one of the acts of life, and so even at that moment to \u0027make the best use of the present\u0027 is enough.\n\n3. Look to what is within: do not allow the intrinsic quality or the worth of any one fact to escape you.\n\n4. All things that exist will very swiftly change; either they will pass into vapour, if we presume that matter is a whole, or else they will be dispersed into their atoms.\n\n5. The controlling Reason knows its own disposition, what it creates, and the material upon which it works.\n\n6. The noblest kind of retribution is not to become like your enemy.\n\n7. Rejoice and set up your rest in one thing: to pass from act to act of fellowship, keeping God in remembrance.\n\n8. The governing principle it is which wakes itself up and adapts itself, making itself of whatever kind it wills and making all that happens to it appear to be of whatever kind it wills.\n\n9. All things are being accomplished in each case according to the nature of the Whole; for certainly they cannot be in accordance with any other nature, whether embracing them without, or enclosed within, or attached to them outside.\n\n10. Either a medley, a mutual interlacing of atoms and their scattering: or unification, order, providence. If then the former, why do I so much as desire to wear out my days in a world compounded by accident and in a confusion governed by chance? Why am I concerned about anything else than how I am in one way or another to \u0027return to earth\u0027? And why am I troubled? Whatever I do, the scattering into atoms will come upon me. But, if the alternative be true, I bow my head, I am calm, I take courage in that which orders all.\n\n11. Whenever you are obliged by circumstances to be in a way troubled, quickly return to yourself, and do not, more than you are obliged, fall out of step; for you will be more master of the measure by continually returning to it.\n\n12. Had you a step-mother and a mother at the same time, you would wait upon the former but still be continually returning to your mother. This is now what the palace and your philosophy are to you. Return to her again and again, and set up your rest in her, on whose account that other life appears tolerable to you and you tolerable in it.\n\n13. Surely it is an excellent plan, when you are seated before delicacies and choice foods, to impress upon your imagination that this is the dead body of a fish, that the dead body of a bird or a pig; and again, that the Falernian wine is grape juice and that robe of purple a lamb\u0027s fleece dipped in a shell-fish\u0027s blood; and in matters of sex intercourse, that it is attrition of an entrail and a convulsive expulsion of mere mucus. Surely these are excellent imaginations, going to the heart of actual facts and penetrating them so as to see the kind of things they really are. You should adopt this practice all through your life, and where things make an impression which is very plausible, uncover their nakedness, see into their cheapness, strip off the profession on which they vaunt themselves. For pride is an arch-seducer of reason, and just when you fancy you are most certainly busy in good works, then you are most certainly the victim of imposture. Consider for instance what Crates says even about Xenocrates.\n\n14. Most of the objects which the vulgar admire may be referred to the general heads of what is held together by \u0027stress\u0027, like minerals and timber, or by \u0027growth\u0027, like figs, vines, olives; those admired by slightly superior folk to things held together by \u0027animal spirit\u0027, for instance flocks and herds or bare ownership of a multitude of slaves; those by persons still more refined to things held together by \u0027reasonable spirit\u0027, not, however, reasonable as such but so far as to be technical or skilled in something else. But one who reveres spirit in its full sense of reasonable and political regards those other objects no longer, but above all continually keeps his own spirit in reasonable and social being and activity, co-operating with a fellow being to this end.\n\n15. Some things are hastening to be, others to have come and gone, and a part of what is coming into being is already extinct. Flux and change renew the world incessantly, as the unbroken passage of time makes boundless eternity ever young. In this river, therefore, on which he cannot stand, which of these things that race past him should a man greatly prize? As though he[1] should begin to set his heart on one of the little sparrows that fly past, when already it has gone away out of his sight. Truly the life of every man is itself as fleeting as the exhalation of spirit from his blood or the breath he draws from the atmosphere. For just as it is to draw in a single breath and to return it, which we do every moment, so is it to render back the whole power of respiration, which you acquired but yesterday or the day before, at birth, to that other world from which you first drew it in.\n\n16. To transpire like plants or to breathe like cattle or wild beasts is not a thing to value, nor to be stamped by sense impression or drawn by the strings of impulse, nor to live in herds or to take in nourishment—this last is on a level with relieving the body of the dregs of that nourishment. What, then, should be valued? The clapping of hands? Surely not; and so not even the clapping of tongues, for the applause of multitudes is a clapping of tongues. Therefore you have put mere glory away. What is left to be valued? To my thinking to move and to be held back according to man\u0027s proper constitution, the end to which both rustic industries and the arts give the lead. (For every art aims at this, that what it fashions should be suited to the purpose for which it has been fashioned. This is the aim of the gardener and of the vine-dresser, of the breaker of colts and the trainer of dogs.) And to what end do children\u0027s training and teaching labour? Here, then, is what is of true value, and if this be well, you will not endeavour to obtain for yourself any one of the rest. Will you not cease to value many other things besides? Then you will not be free or self-contained or passionless; for you will be obliged to entertain envy and rivalry, to regard with suspicion those who are able to take away those things, to plot against those who have what is valued by you. To sum up, he who feels the want of any one of those things must be sullied thereby and besides must often blame the gods. But to reverence and value your own understanding will make you acceptable to yourself, harmonious with your fellows, and in concord with the gods; that is, praising whatsoever they assign and have ordained.\n\n17. The motions of the Elements are up, down, in circles: the movement of man\u0027s excellence is in none of these, but proceeding in a more divine way and on a path past finding out it fares well.\n\n18. Only think what it is they do. They refuse to speak good of men living at the same time and in their company, yet themselves set great store on being spoken well of by those who will be born after them, whom they have never seen and never will see. Yet this is next door to being sad because men born before you were not speaking good words about you.\n\n19. Do not because a thing is hard for you yourself to accomplish, imagine that it is humanly impossible: but if a thing is humanly possible and appropriate, consider it also to be within your own reach.\n\n20. In the field a player may have scratched us with his nails or given us a blow with his head, in a rage, yet we do not label him for that or hit back or suspect him afterwards of designs against us. Still, we do, in fact, keep away from him, not, however, as a foe and not with suspicion but with good-natured avoidance. Let us take this for an example in other departments of life; let us overlook much in the case of those who are, so to speak, our opponents in the game; for, as I said, it is possible to avoid them, yet neither to suspect nor hate them.\n\n21. Suppose a man can convince me of error and bring home to me that I am mistaken in thought or act; I shall be glad to alter, for the truth is what I pursue, and no one was ever injured by the truth, whereas he is injured who continues in his own self-deception and ignorance.\n\n22. Let me do my own duty; nothing else distracts me, for it is either lifeless or without reason or has gone astray and is ignorant of the true path.\n\n23. Use dumb animals and lifeless things and objects generally with a generous and free spirit, because you have reason and they have not; use men because they have reason, in a neighbourly spirit; and in all things call upon the gods for help. Let it make no difference to you for how long a time you will do these things, for even three hours in this spirit is enough.\n\n24. Alexander the Great and his stable boy were levelled in death, for they were either taken up into the same life-giving principles of the Universe or were scattered without distinction into atoms.\n\n25. Reflect upon the multitude of bodily and mental events taking place in the same brief time, simultaneously in every one of us; and so you will not be surprised that many more events, or rather all things that come to pass, exist simultaneously in the one and entire unity, which we call the Universe.\n\n26. Suppose a man puts you the problem how to write the name Antoninus. Will you raise your voice to pronounce each of its component parts? Then suppose they are angry, will you be angry in return? Will you not quietly enumerate and go over in succession each of the letters? In the same way then, in our life here, remember that every duty has its complement of definite numbers. These you must preserve and not be troubled, and if men make difficulties, not meet them with difficulties, but bring what you propose to do methodically to completion.\n\n27. How inhuman it is to forbid men to set out after what appears suitable and advantageous to themselves. Yet, in a way, you are not allowing them to do this, whenever you are indignant because they do wrong; for certainly they are moved to what looks to be suitable and advantageous to themselves. \u0027But it is, in fact, not so.\u0027 Very well, instruct them and make it plain; don\u0027t be indignant.\n\n28. Death is repose from sense-response, from the stimulus of impulse, from intellectual analysis and the service of the flesh.\n\n29. It is absurdly wrong that, in this life where your body does not give in, your spirit should be the first to surrender.\n\n30. Take heed not to be transformed into a Caesar, not to be dipped in the purple dye; for it does happen. Keep yourself therefore, simple, good, pure, grave, unaffected, the friend of justice, religious, kind, affectionate, strong for your proper work. Wrestle to continue to be the man Philosophy wished to make you. Reverence the gods, save men. Life is brief; there is one harvest of earthly existence, a holy disposition and neighbourly acts. In all things like a pupil of Antoninus; his energy on behalf of what was done in accord with reason, his equability everywhere, his serene expression, his sweetness, his disdain of glory, his ambition to grasp affairs.\n\nAlso how he let nothing at all pass without first looking well into it and understanding it clearly; how he would suffer those who blamed him unjustly, not blaming them in return; how he was in no hurry about anything; how he refused to entertain slander; how exactly he scrutinized men\u0027s characters and actions, was not given to reproach, not alarmed by rumour, not suspicious, not affecting to be wise; how he was content with little, in lodging, in his bed, in dress, in food, in service; how he loved work and was long-suffering.\n\nWhat a man, too, he was to remain in his place until evening; because of his spare diet not needing even to relieve nature except at his usual hour. Moreover, his constancy and uniformity to his friends, his tolerance of plain-spoken opposition to his opinions and delight when any one indicated a better course; and how he revered the gods without superstition. So may your last hour find you, like him, with a conscience void of reproach.\n\n31. Be sober once more, recall yourself and shake off sleep again. Perceive that they were dreams which troubled you, and once again fully awake, look at these things as you looked at those.\n\n32. I am composed of body and spirit. Now to the body all things are indifferent, for it cannot distinguish them itself. And to the understanding all that are not its own activities are indifferent, and all that are its own activities are in its control. Even of these, however, it is concerned only about the present, for its future and past activities are themselves also at the present moment indifferent.\n\n33. Neither pain of hand nor pain of foot is contrary to Nature, provided the foot is doing the service of a foot or the hand of a hand. It follows that not even for a man, as man, is pain contrary to Nature, while he is doing the service of a man, and if pain for him is not contrary to Nature, neither is it an evil for him.\n\n34. What monstrous pleasures brigands, pathics, parricides, and despots enjoy.\n\n35. Do you not see how mechanic craftsmen suit themselves up to a point to amateurs, yet none the less stick to the rule of their craft and never submit to desert that? Is it not grievous, then, that architect and physician will reverence, each the principle of his art, more than man his own principle, which he has in common with the gods?\n\n36. Asia and Europe are corners in the Universe; every sea, a drop in the Universe; Mount Athos, a clod of earth in the Universe; every instant of time, a pin-prick of eternity. All things are petty, easily changed, vanishing away. All things come from that other world, starting from that common governing principle, or else are secondary consequences of it. Thus, even the lion\u0027s jaws, deadly poison, and every injurious thing, like a thistle or a bog, are by-products from those august and lovely principles. Do not, then, imagine them to be contrary to what you reverence, but reflect upon the fountain of all things.\n\n37. He who sees what is now has seen all things, whatsoever came to pass from everlasting and whatsoever shall be unto unlimited time. For all things are of one kin and of one kind.\n\n38. Meditate often upon the bond of all in the Universe and their mutual relationship. For all things are in a way woven together and all are because of this dear to one another; for these follow in order one upon another because of the stress-movement and common spirit and the unification of matter.\n\n39. Fit yourself into accord with the things in which your portion has been cast, and love the men among whom your lot has fallen, but love them truly.\n\n40. Every instrument, tool, and vessel is well off, if it carry out the work for which it was fashioned. Yet here the maker is outside the tool. Where things are held together by a natural principle, the power which made them is within and abides with them. You must accordingly reverence it the more, and believe that if you are and continue according to the will of that power, you have all things to your mind. And in like manner its things are to the mind of the All.\n\n41. Should you propose to yourself as good or evil something beyond your will, the necessary result is that, if you fall into that evil or fail of that good, you blame the gods and you hate men who are or who you suspect will be the causes of your loss of the good or your falling into the evil; and indeed we commit many wrongs from concern in regard to these things, If, however, we decide that only what our will controls is good or evil, then no ground is left either to arraign God or to adopt the position of an enemy to man.\n\n42. We are all working together to a single end, some consciously and with understanding, some without knowledge, as Heraclitus, I think, says that even \u0027Sleepers are workers and fellow-workers in what comes to pass in the world\u0027. One helps in one way, one in another, and ex abundanti even he who finds fault and tries to resist or destroy what is coming to pass; for the Universe has need even for such a one. Finally, therefore, see with which you take your post, for in any event he who controls the whole will employ you aright and will accept you as one part of the fellow-labourers and fellow-workers; only do not you become as mean a part as the cheap and ridiculous verse in the comedy, which Chrysippus mentions.\n\n43. Does the Sun god claim to do the work of the god of rain, or Aesculapius the work of the Fruit-bearing goddess? And how is it with each of the stars? Is not their province different, but they are working together to the same end?\n\n44. If so be that the gods took counsel about me and what must happen to me, they took counsel for good; for it is not easy to conceive a god without purpose, and on what possible ground would they be likely to desire to do me harm? What advantage would there be from this either for themselves or for the common good, which is their principal care? But if they took no counsel about me as an individual, surely they did for the common good, and as the present follows upon that by way of consequence, I am bound to welcome and to love it. But suppose they take counsel, if you will, about nothing (a thing it is impious to believe, or else let us cease to sacrifice and pray to them, to swear by them and to do all else that we do, believing them to be present and living in our midst); yet still, suppose they take counsel about none of our concerns, I am able to take counsel about myself, and my consideration is about what is advantageous. Now the advantage of each is what is proper to his own constitution and nature, and my nature is reasonable and social. As Antoninus, my city and my fatherland is Rome; as a man, the Universe. All then that benefits these cities is alone my good.\n\n45. All that befalls the individual is to the advantage of the Whole. This should be enough. However, if you watch carefully, you will generally see this besides: what advantages a man also advantages the rest of men; but here advantage must be taken in its more usual acceptance of what lies in between good and evil.\n\n46. Just as the performances in the amphitheatre and such places pall upon you, being for ever the same scenes, and the similarity makes the spectacle nauseating, so you feel in the same way about life as a whole; for all things, up and down, are the same and follow from the same. How long will it last?\n\n47. Think constantly of the death of men of all sorts, of all sorts of pursuits and of every kind of nation, so that your thought comes down to Philistio, Phoebus, and Origanio. Now pass on to the remaining classes of men. We are bound to change to that other world, where are so many subtle orators, so many grave philosophers, Heraclitus, Pythagoras, and Socrates; so many heroes of old, captains and kings of later days. Besides these, Eudoxus, Hipparchus, and Archimedes, other acute natures, great minds, hard workers, rogues, self-willed men, those who made mock of man\u0027s mortal and transient life itself, like Menippus and all of his kind. Of them all reflect that long ago they were laid in the ground. Why was it dreadful for them, why dreadful for those whose names are not even remembered? One thing here is of great price, to live out life with truth and righteousness, gracious to liars and to the unrighteous.\n\n48. Whenever you desire to cheer yourself, think upon the merits of those who are alive with you; the energy of one, for instance, the modesty of another, the generosity of a third, of another some other gift. For nothing is so cheering as the images of the virtues shining in the character of contemporaries, and meeting so far as possible in a group. Therefore you should keep them ready to your hand.\n\n49. You are not discontented, surely, because you weigh only so many pounds and not three hundred? So, too, because you may only live so many years and no longer? As you are contented with the quantity of matter determined for you, so also be contented with your days.\n\n50. Endeavour to persuade them, but act even if they themselves are unwilling, when the rule of justice so directs. If, however, a man employs force to resist, change your object to resignation and freedom from a sense of present injury, and use the opposition to elicit in yourself a different virtue. Remember, too, that you set out with a reservation and were not aiming at the impossible. What then was your aim? \u0027An aim qualified by a reservation.\u0027 But you do achieve this; what we proposed to ourselves does come to pass.\n\n51. He who loves glory thinks the activity of another to be his own good; he who loves pleasure thinks his own feeling to be his good; he who has intelligence, thinks his own action to be his good.\n\n52. It is possible to entertain no thought about this, and not to be troubled in spirit; for things of themselves are not so constituted as to create our judgements upon them.\n\n53. Habituate yourself not to be inattentive to what another has to say and, so far as possible, be in the mind of the speaker.\n\n54. What does not benefit the hive is no benefit to the bee.\n\n55. If the crew spoke evil of the master of the ship or his patients of the doctor, would they listen to any one else? Or how should the master achieve safety for the passengers or health for those he is treating?\n\n56. How many in whose company I came into the world are gone away already!\n\n57. Honey appears bitter to the jaundiced, water is dreaded by those bitten by a mad dog, and to little boys a ball seems a fine thing. Why then am I angry? Or do you think that misrepresentation has smaller power over men than bile over the jaundiced or poison over the victim of a bite?\n\n58. No one will prevent your living by the rule of your own nature: nothing will happen to you contrary to the rule of Universal Nature.\n\n59. What creatures they are whom they wish to please, and by what kind of results and what kind of actions! How swiftly eternity will cover all things, and how many it has covered already!",

      "text": "Here\u0027s a thinking process for translating Marcus Aurelius Book VI into the \"Bro\" style:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants a \"Bro\" version of Marcus Aurelius\u0027 Meditations, Book VI. This means translating the stoic philosophical concepts into modern, informal, somewhat masculine-coded, often slightly irreverent, but still *accurate* and *meaningful* language. The previous Enchiridion example serves as a style guide. Key elements of that style:\n    *   Direct address (\"You\").\n    *   Informal language (\"stuff,\" \"screw-up,\" \"kiss ass,\" \"get pissed\").\n    *   Modern analogies (gym, traffic, job rejection, phone).\n    *   Emphasis on practicality and action.\n    *   Focus on internal control vs. external chaos.\n    *   Slightly assertive, straightforward tone.\n    *   Retention of the core stoic message.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Source Text (Book VI):** Read through Book VI section by section, grasping the core idea of each passage. Marcus Aurelius\u0027 style is reflective, sometimes abstract, focused on the nature of the universe (the Whole), reason, duty, change, death, and dealing with others. Key recurring themes in Book VI:\n    *   The Universe/Nature/Reason is fundamentally good and orderly.\n    *   Focus on your specific duty/job.\n    *   Accept externals (discomfort, bad reputation, death) indifferently.\n    *   Look inward for value.\n    *   Everything changes rapidly; don\u0027t cling.\n    *   The best revenge is not being like the offender.\n    *   Control your inner response/governing principle.\n    *   We are interconnected and part of a larger whole.\n    *   Practice perspective-taking (seeing things for what they really are).\n    *   Deal with others patiently, understanding their mistaken views.\n    *   Don\u0027t chase empty praise or superficial admiration.\n    *   Act according to reason and social duty.\n    *   Keep mortality in mind.\n    *   Learn from good examples.\n    *   Accept your limits (lifespan, physical capacity).\n    *   Work with others, even difficult ones.\n    *   Gods/Providence (or atomic chaos, but either way, act right).\n\n3.  **Translate Section by Section, Applying the \"Bro\" Style:**\n\n    *   **VI.1 (Nature is Good):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* The universe\u0027s substance is malleable; its controlling Reason isn\u0027t evil and doesn\u0027t cause harm; everything happens according to it.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"The universe,\" \"the big picture,\" \"how things work.\" \"Docile and adaptable\" -\u003e \"rolls with punches,\" \"flexible.\" \"Reason that controls it\" -\u003e \"the underlying logic,\" \"the system.\" \"No ground to create evil\" -\u003e \"doesn\u0027t *want* to screw things up,\" \"not wired for bad.\" \"All things... according to it\" -\u003e \"it all fits the master plan.\"\n        *   *Draft:* The universe, the big system, it\u0027s workable, adaptable. The logic running it? It\u0027s not malicious. It doesn\u0027t *have* evil in it, doesn\u0027t mess things up on purpose. Everything happens according to its rules.\n\n    *   **VI.2 (Indifference to Externals while Doing Duty):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* While doing your job, don\u0027t worry about being cold/hot, tired/rested, praised/criticized, even dying. Death is just another action. Focus on the present task.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Proper work\" -\u003e \"your job,\" \"what you gotta do.\" \"Indifferent\" -\u003e \"shouldn\u0027t matter,\" \"don\u0027t sweat it.\" List of externals -\u003e keep them simple, maybe use slang. \"Act of death\" -\u003e \"even kicking the bucket.\" \"Make the best use of the present\" -\u003e \"nail what\u0027s in front of you,\" \"own the moment.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Look, when you\u0027re doing your job, don\u0027t get hung up on whether you\u0027re freezing or comfy, exhausted or sharp, getting trashed or praised, or even if you\u0027re dying. Yeah, even kicking the bucket is just another life event. So just focus on nailing what you gotta do *right now*. That\u0027s enough.\n\n    *   **VI.3 (Look Within):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Examine things internally; don\u0027t miss their real quality or value.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Look to what is within\" -\u003e \"check under the hood,\" \"see the real deal.\" \"Intrinsic quality or worth\" -\u003e \"what it\u0027s *really* made of,\" \"its actual value.\" \"Escape you\" -\u003e \"don\u0027t miss it.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Look under the hood. Don\u0027t let the real quality or value of *anything* slip past you. See it for what it is.\n\n    *   **VI.4 (Change is Constant):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Everything changes quickly, either dissolving into vapor (if matter is one) or scattering into atoms.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Swiftly change\" -\u003e \"gonna vanish fast,\" \"won\u0027t last.\" \"Vapor\" or \"atoms\" -\u003e simplify to \"break down,\" \"disappear.\" Keep the core idea of impermanence.\n        *   *Draft:* Everything you see? It\u0027s gonna change, fast. Either it turns back into basic energy or breaks down into tiny pieces. Nothing lasts.\n\n    *   **VI.5 (Reason Knows Itself):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* The controlling Reason understands its nature, creations, and materials.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Controlling Reason\" -\u003e \"the system,\" \"the logic behind things.\" \"Knows its own disposition...\" -\u003e \"knows its own game,\" \"knows what it\u0027s doing,\" \"understands its tools and creations.\"\n        *   *Draft:* The system\u0027s logic knows what it\u0027s about, what it makes, and the raw materials it uses. It gets the picture.\n\n    *   **VI.6 (Best Revenge):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Noblest retribution is not becoming like the offender.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Keep this close, it\u0027s punchy. \"Noblest kind of retribution\" -\u003e \"best way to get back,\" \"ultimate payback.\" \"Not to become like your enemy\" -\u003e \"don\u0027t sink to their level.\"\n        *   *Draft:* The best way to get back at someone? Don\u0027t become like them. Don\u0027t sink to their level.\n\n    *   **VI.7 (Joy in Social Action):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Find joy and rest in moving from one social act to another, remembering God/divine.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Rejoice and set up your rest\" -\u003e \"find your peace,\" \"get your satisfaction.\" \"Act to act of fellowship\" -\u003e \"doing good for others,\" \"helping the team,\" \"being a good dude.\" \"Keeping God in remembrance\" -\u003e \"staying aligned with the big picture,\" \"remembering your principles.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Find your real satisfaction in this: moving from one helpful action to the next, keeping the bigger picture (or your core principles) in mind.\n\n    *   **VI.8 (Mind Controls Perception):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* The governing principle (mind) wakes itself, adapts, makes itself what it wills, and interprets events as it wills.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Governing principle\" -\u003e \"your mind,\" \"your control center.\" \"Wakes itself up...\" -\u003e \"takes charge,\" \"adapts,\" \"decides how it sees things.\" \"Making all that happens... appear...\" -\u003e \"frames reality,\" \"spins the situation.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Your mind is the command center. It wakes itself up, adapts, makes itself whatever it wants to be, and decides how to frame *everything* that happens to you.\n\n    *   **VI.9 (All Fits the Whole):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Everything happens according to the Nature of the Whole, not some external or separate nature.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Nature of the Whole\" -\u003e \"the system,\" \"how reality works.\" \"Cannot be in accordance with any other nature...\" -\u003e \"it\u0027s all part of the same big system,\" \"no outside force messing things up.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Everything happens according to the rules of the whole system. There isn\u0027t some other rogue system calling the shots from outside or inside. It\u0027s all interconnected.\n\n    *   **VI.10 (Order vs. Chaos - Choose Action):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Either the universe is a random mess (medley/scattering) or it\u0027s ordered (unification/providence). If random, why worry? Just return to earth. If ordered, accept it calmly.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Medley... scattering\" -\u003e \"random chaos,\" \"just atoms bumping around.\" \"Unification, order, providence\" -\u003e \"an ordered system,\" \"a plan.\" \"Why desire to wear out my days...\" -\u003e \"why waste time stressing?\" \"\u0027Return to earth\u0027\" -\u003e \"end up as dust.\" \"Why am I troubled?\" -\u003e \"what\u0027s the point of freaking out?\" \"If the alternative be true...\" -\u003e \"if there\u0027s order...\" \"I bow my head...\" -\u003e \"I accept it,\" \"I trust the process.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Okay, two options: Either life\u0027s just random chaos, atoms bumping and scattering. Or there\u0027s order, a plan, some kind of providence. If it\u0027s just chaos, why waste energy stressing? Why care about anything other than eventually turning back to dust? Why freak out? The scattering will happen no matter what. BUT, if there *is* order, then I chill out, accept it, and trust the system.\n\n    *   **VI.11 (Return to Self When Troubled):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* When upset by circumstances, quickly return to your inner self; don\u0027t stay out of rhythm longer than needed. Regain mastery by returning.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Obliged by circumstances to be troubled\" -\u003e \"when life throws you off,\" \"when stuff rattles you.\" \"Quickly return to yourself\" -\u003e \"snap back to your center,\" \"regroup internally.\" \"Fall out of step\" -\u003e \"lose your cool,\" \"get off balance.\" \"Master of the measure\" -\u003e \"control,\" \"poise.\"\n        *   *Draft:* When crap happens and throws you off balance, snap back to your center fast. Don\u0027t stay knocked off-kilter longer than you absolutely have to. You get better control the quicker you regroup internally.\n\n    *   **VI.12 (Philosophy as Home Base):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Like returning to a mother over a step-mother, return often to philosophy from the \u0027palace\u0027 (worldly life). Find rest in philosophy.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* The analogy might be dated. Focus on the core idea: Philosophy is the reliable refuge. \"Palace\" -\u003e \"the daily grind,\" \"the world\u0027s demands.\" \"Philosophy\" -\u003e \"your principles,\" \"your core values,\" \"this way of thinking.\" \"Return to her...\" -\u003e \"Keep coming back,\" \"Anchor yourself.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Think of it like this: You\u0027ve got the daily grind, the worldly demands (like a step-mother you deal with). And you\u0027ve got your core principles, your philosophy (your real home base, Mom). Keep coming back to your philosophy. Anchor yourself there. It makes the daily grind bearable, and makes *you* bearable *in* the grind.\n\n    *   **VI.13 (See Things Plainly):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* See fancy food, wine, clothes, sex for what they physically are (dead animals, grape juice, dyed wool, bodily functions). Strip away the pretentious labels. Pride deceives.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* This needs modernizing but keep the directness. Fancy food -\u003e \"that gourmet meal.\" Falernian wine -\u003e \"expensive booze.\" Purple robe -\u003e \"designer clothes.\" Sex -\u003e keep it blunt but maybe slightly less clinical than \"entrails/mucus.\" \"Attrition,\" \"convulsive expulsion\" -\u003e \"friction,\" \"biological process.\" \"Uncover their nakedness...\" -\u003e \"strip away the hype,\" \"see the raw reality.\" \"Pride is an arch-seducer...\" -\u003e \"Ego is a bullshit artist.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Seriously, practice this: When you see fancy stuff – gourmet food, expensive booze, designer clothes – remind yourself what it *actually* is. That steak? Dead animal. That vintage wine? Fermented grape juice. Those fancy clothes? Sheep wool dipped in crushed bug juice (or whatever). Sex? It’s friction and a biological process. Strip away the hype. See things for what they are, plainly. Ego is a master bullshitter; just when you think you\u0027re doing something important based on hype, you\u0027re probably getting played. Look past the labels.\n\n    *   **VI.14 (Levels of Admiration):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* People admire things held by \u0027stress\u0027 (objects), \u0027growth\u0027 (plants), \u0027animal spirit\u0027 (herds, slaves), \u0027reasonable spirit\u0027 (skills). The highest admiration is for rational, social spirit itself, working with others.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Simplify the categories. \"Vulgar admire\" -\u003e \"most people chase.\" \u0027Stress\u0027/\u0027growth\u0027 -\u003e \"basic stuff,\" \"possessions.\" \u0027Animal spirit\u0027 -\u003e \"power over others,\" \"owning stuff/people.\" \u0027Reasonable spirit\u0027 (skills) -\u003e \"being technically good at something.\" \u0027Reasonable and political spirit\u0027 -\u003e \"true reason,\" \"wisdom,\" \"contributing to the community.\" \"Regards those other objects no longer\" -\u003e \"stops caring about the shallow stuff.\" \"Co-operating with a fellow being\" -\u003e \"working with others for the common good.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Most people chase basic stuff (possessions, things held together physically). Slightly smarter folks admire power or owning lots (like herds or control over others). Even smarter ones admire technical skill, being good *at* something. But the guy who truly gets it? He values *reason itself* – being rational, contributing to the community. He stops chasing the other stuff and focuses on using his reason well, working with others towards shared goals.\n\n    *   **VI.15 (Flux and Impermanence):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Things appear and disappear constantly. Time renews the world. In this flow, what\u0027s worth prizing? Life is fleeting like breath.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Hastening to be...\" -\u003e \"stuff\u0027s always coming and going.\" \"Flux and change\" -\u003e \"constant change.\" \"Boundless eternity ever young\" -\u003e \"time just keeps rolling.\" \"River... cannot stand\" -\u003e \"life\u0027s a rushing river, you can\u0027t stand still.\" \"Prize?\" -\u003e \"get attached to?\" Sparrow analogy -\u003e keep it, it\u0027s good. Breath analogy -\u003e keep it, connect it to the temporary nature of life.\n        *   *Draft:* Stuff is constantly appearing and vanishing. Change never stops, making the world feel new even as time rolls on forever. Life is like a rushing river – you can\u0027t step in the same place twice. So why get deeply attached to anything flowing past? It\u0027s like falling in love with a bird that flies by and is gone instantly. Your whole life is as temporary as breathing in and out – one breath comes, one goes. Your whole existence is like giving back the breath you took when you were born.\n\n    *   **VI.16 (What Has Real Value?):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Basic life functions (breathing like animals, sense impressions, herd instinct, eating/excreting) aren\u0027t valuable. Applause isn\u0027t valuable. What is? Acting according to our proper (rational, social) constitution, as arts/crafts aim for suitability. This brings freedom and avoids envy/plotting. Reverence for understanding brings peace.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Transpire like plants...\" -\u003e \"just existing like a plant or animal.\" \"Stamped by sense impression...\" -\u003e \"being pushed around by feelings or urges.\" \"Clapping of hands/tongues\" -\u003e \"applause,\" \"likes,\" \"popularity.\" \"Mere glory\" -\u003e \"empty fame.\" \"What is left to be valued?\" -\u003e \"So what *does* matter?\" \"Move and be held back according to man\u0027s proper constitution\" -\u003e \"acting intentionally,\" \"living by your principles.\" Art/craft analogy -\u003e \"getting the job done right,\" \"purposeful action.\" \"Training and teaching\" -\u003e \"learning and growth.\" \"True value\" -\u003e \"what\u0027s really worthwhile.\" Consequences of chasing externals (envy, suspicion, plotting) -\u003e simplify. \"Reverence and value your own understanding\" -\u003e \"respecting your own judgment,\" \"valuing your ability to think clearly.\" Concord with gods -\u003e \"aligned with reality.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Just breathing, reacting to stuff, following impulses, eating and shitting – that\u0027s not what makes life valuable. That\u0027s just basic animal function. Getting applause? Likes? Nah, that’s just noise. Forget empty fame. So, what *is* valuable? Acting deliberately, according to your human design – with reason and purpose. Like any craft aims to make something fit for its job, your aim is to act rightly. That\u0027s what real learning and growth are about. *That\u0027s* the real prize. If you get this, you won\u0027t desperately chase other stuff. You won\u0027t be trapped by envy, suspicion, or scheming against people who have what you wrongly value. Value your own damn mind, your ability to reason. That brings self-respect, gets you in sync with others, and aligns you with how things actually work.\n\n    *   **VI.17 (Movement of Excellence):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Elements move physically (up/down/circles). Human excellence moves differently, divinely, mysteriously, achieving success.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Keep the contrast. \"Motions of the Elements\" -\u003e \"physical stuff moves predictably.\" \"Movement of man\u0027s excellence\" -\u003e \"how virtue works,\" \"human potential.\" \"More divine way...\" -\u003e \"on a higher level,\" \"harder to track but effective.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Physical stuff moves predictably – up, down, in circles. But human excellence, virtue? That moves differently. It\u0027s on a higher level, harder to pin down, but it gets results.\n\n    *   **VI.18 (Seeking Posthumous Fame):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* It\u0027s weird to ignore contemporaries but crave praise from future people you\u0027ll never meet. Like being sad that past people didn\u0027t praise you.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Keep the absurdity. \"Refuse to speak good of men living...\" -\u003e \"trash talk people around them.\" \"Set great store on being spoken well of by those who will be born after them\" -\u003e \"desperate for praise from people not even born yet.\" \"Never seen and never will see\" -\u003e emphasize the disconnect. Analogy -\u003e keep it.\n        *   *Draft:* How weird is this: Guys who won\u0027t say a good word about the people actually around them, but desperately crave praise from future generations they\u0027ll never meet? That makes as much sense as being bummed that people born *before* you weren\u0027t singing your praises. Pointless.\n\n    *   **VI.19 (Possible Means Reachable):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* If something is humanly possible and appropriate, don\u0027t assume it\u0027s impossible for *you* just because it\u0027s hard. Consider it reachable.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Make it motivational. \"Hard for you yourself\" -\u003e \"feels tough for you.\" \"Humanly impossible\" -\u003e \"can\u0027t be done by anyone.\" \"Humanly possible and appropriate\" -\u003e \"someone can do it, and it\u0027s a reasonable goal.\" \"Within your own reach\" -\u003e \"you can probably do it too.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Just because something feels hard *for you* right now, don\u0027t automatically assume it\u0027s impossible for *anyone*. If it\u0027s something humans *can* do, and it fits your nature, then consider it within *your* reach too. Don\u0027t sell yourself short.\n\n    *   **VI.20 (Dealing with Annoyances/Opponents):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* In sports, opponents might hurt you accidentally (scratch, headbutt), but we don\u0027t label them enemies or suspect malice. We avoid them good-naturedly. Apply this to life: overlook much, avoid without suspicion or hate.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Sports analogy works well. Keep it. \"Scratched us with his nails...\" -\u003e \"a cheap shot,\" \"an accidental foul.\" \"Do not label him... or hit back...\" -\u003e \"don\u0027t hold a grudge,\" \"don\u0027t retaliate personally.\" \"Keep away... good-natured avoidance\" -\u003e \"give \u0027em space,\" \"steer clear without drama.\" \"Opponents in the game\" -\u003e \"people who piss you off,\" \"difficult colleagues.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Think about playing sports. Someone might accidentally scratch you or knock heads with you in the heat of the moment. You don\u0027t label them an enemy for life, get triggered, or assume they\u0027re plotting against you, right? You just kinda steer clear of them, maybe, but without hate or suspicion – just good-natured avoidance. Do the same in life. Overlook a lot with people who are basically \"opponents\" in the daily game. You can avoid them without needing to suspect or hate them.\n\n    *   **VI.21 (Welcoming Correction):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* If someone shows you\u0027re wrong, be glad to change. Truth is the goal, and truth never harms; staying in error does.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Convince me of error\" -\u003e \"prove me wrong,\" \"show me my mistake.\" \"Glad to alter\" -\u003e \"happy to change my mind.\" \"Truth is what I pursue\" -\u003e \"I\u0027m after what\u0027s real.\" \"Injured by the truth\" -\u003e \"truth doesn\u0027t hurt anyone.\" \"Injured who continues in self-deception\" -\u003e \"sticking to your bullshit is what screws you up.\"\n        *   *Draft:* If someone can show me I\u0027m wrong, prove I messed up in my thinking or actions? I\u0027ll gladly change course. I\u0027m chasing truth here, and truth never hurt anybody. What *does* hurt is staying stuck in your own ignorance and bullshit.\n\n    *   **VI.22 (Focus on Duty):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Do your duty; nothing else should distract. Other things are lifeless, irrational, or lost.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Do my own duty\" -\u003e \"focus on my job,\" \"handle my responsibilities.\" \"Nothing else distracts me\" -\u003e \"the rest is noise.\" \"Lifeless or without reason...\" -\u003e \"it\u0027s either inanimate, irrational, or clueless.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Let me just do my job. Nothing else matters or distracts me. Everything else is either just an object, lacks reason, or is totally lost and doesn\u0027t know the way.\n\n    *   **VI.23 (Using Things and People Rightly):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Use animals/objects generously (you have reason, they don\u0027t). Use men neighborly (they have reason). Call on gods. Time doesn\u0027t matter (3 hours is enough).\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Dumb animals and lifeless things\" -\u003e \"animals and objects.\" \"Generous and free spirit\" -\u003e \"fairly,\" \"without being a dick.\" \"Use men... neighbourly spirit\" -\u003e \"treat people like people,\" \"be decent.\" \"Call upon the gods\" -\u003e \"ask for guidance,\" \"align with the big picture.\" Time limit -\u003e emphasize quality over quantity.\n        *   *Draft:* Treat animals and objects fairly and generously – you have reason, they don\u0027t. Treat people with respect and cooperation – you both have reason. And in everything, align yourself with the bigger principles (call on the gods). Don\u0027t worry about how long you do this for; even three solid hours of living right is worthwhile.\n\n    *   **VI.24 (Death Levels All):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Alexander the Great and his stable boy ended up the same in death, either reabsorbed or scattered into atoms.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Keep the contrast. Alexander -\u003e \"the big shot CEO,\" \"the famous general.\" Stable boy -\u003e \"the regular dude,\" \"the janitor.\" \"Levelled in death\" -\u003e \"death makes everyone equal.\" Reabsorbed/scattered -\u003e \"ended up the same dust.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Alexander the Great and his horse groom? Death made them equals. They both ended up either reabsorbed into the universe\u0027s core elements or scattered into atoms. Same endpoint.\n\n    *   **VI.25 (Simultaneity in the Universe):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Reflect on the many bodily/mental events happening simultaneously in each person. Then realize how many more happen simultaneously in the entire Universe (the Whole).\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Multitude of bodily and mental events\" -\u003e \"all the shit happening in your body and mind.\" \"Simultaneously\" -\u003e \"at the exact same time.\" Universe -\u003e \"the whole damn cosmos.\" \"One and entire unity\" -\u003e \"one big interconnected system.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Think about all the stuff happening inside you *right now* – thoughts, feelings, physical processes, all at once. Wild, right? Now multiply that by everyone and everything else. You won\u0027t be surprised then that countless things are happening simultaneously across the entire universe, all part of one big interconnected reality.\n\n    *   **VI.26 (Methodical Approach to Tasks/Duties):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* If asked how to spell \u0027Antoninus\u0027, you wouldn\u0027t shout. You\u0027d calmly list the letters. Do the same with duties: they have steps (\u0027numbers\u0027). Stick to the steps methodically, don\u0027t get angry if others resist.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Spelling analogy is a bit quaint. Maybe update it? \"Write code,\" \"follow a recipe,\" \"assemble furniture.\" Keep the core idea: break down tasks, follow the process calmly. \"Complement of definite numbers\" -\u003e \"a set number of steps,\" \"a process.\" \"Preserve and not be troubled\" -\u003e \"stick to the plan, stay cool.\" \"If men make difficulties...\" -\u003e \"if people push back...\"\n        *   *Draft:* If someone asks you how to spell a name, you don\u0027t yell the letters, right? You calmly list them out: A-N-T-O... Same deal with your duties in life. Every task has steps. Know the steps, stick to them calmly, and don\u0027t lose your cool or get into a shouting match if others give you grief. Just methodically finish what you started.\n\n    *   **VI.27 (Instruct, Don\u0027t Condemn):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* It\u0027s inhuman to stop people pursuing what *they think* is good for them. When they err, they\u0027re just mistaken about what\u0027s advantageous. So, instruct them, show them, don\u0027t just get indignant.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Forbid men to set out after what appears suitable...\" -\u003e \"stop people from going after what *they think* is best.\" \"You are not allowing them... whenever you are indignant\" -\u003e \"you\u0027re basically doing that when you just get pissed off at their mistakes.\" \"Moved to what looks to be suitable...\" -\u003e \"they *think* they\u0027re doing the right thing for themselves.\" \"\u0027But it is, in fact, not so.\u0027\" -\u003e \"Okay, they\u0027re wrong.\" \"Very well, instruct them...\" -\u003e \"So teach them, show them the right way. Don\u0027t just get mad.\"\n        *   *Draft:* It’s messed up to block people from chasing what *they* think is right or good for them. And honestly, that’s what you’re doing when you just get pissed off that they screwed up. They’re acting based on *their* (flawed) idea of what’s good. Okay, so their idea is wrong? Fine. *Teach them*. Show them the better way. Don\u0027t just get indignant like a child.\n\n    *   **VI.28 (Death as Repose):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Death is rest from senses, impulses, analysis, and bodily service.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Repose\" -\u003e \"a break,\" \"peace.\" \"Sense-response\" -\u003e \"reacting to everything.\" \"Stimulus of impulse\" -\u003e \"being jerked around by desires.\" \"Intellectual analysis\" -\u003e \"overthinking.\" \"Service of the flesh\" -\u003e \"bodily demands.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Death is just hitting pause. A break from reacting to every little thing, from being yanked around by impulses, from endless mental chatter, and from the body\u0027s constant needs.\n\n    *   **VI.29 (Mind Over Body):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* It\u0027s absurd that your spirit gives in before your body does.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Keep it direct and slightly shaming. \"Absurdly wrong\" -\u003e \"pathetic,\" \"ridiculous.\" \"Body does not give in\" -\u003e \"your body keeps going.\" \"Spirit should be the first to surrender\" -\u003e \"your mind quits first.\"\n        *   *Draft:* It’s pathetic if your mind quits before your body does. Your body can take a beating, keep going – don\u0027t let your spirit be the weak link that surrenders first.\n\n    *   **VI.30 (Be Good, Not Caesar; Emulate Antoninus):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Don\u0027t become power-hungry (\u0027Caesar,\u0027 \u0027purple dye\u0027). Be simple, good, just, kind, strong for your work. Wrestle to be what Philosophy intends. Reverence gods, help people. Life is short: holy disposition, neighborly acts. Emulate Antoninus Pius: his rationality, calmness, humility, thoroughness, patience with critics, lack of hurry, scrutiny, contentment, work ethic, consistency, tolerance, piety. Aim for a clear conscience like his.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Transformed into a Caesar\" -\u003e \"don\u0027t turn into a power-tripping asshole.\" \"Dipped in the purple dye\" -\u003e \"don\u0027t get corrupted by status.\" Keep the list of virtues, maybe slightly modernizing. \"Simple, good, pure...\" -\u003e \"straight-up, decent, real.\" \"Friend of justice...\" -\u003e \"fair, god-respecting (or principle-respecting), kind, reliable, tough enough for the job.\" \"Wrestle to continue...\" -\u003e \"Fight to stay the course.\" \"Philosophy wished to make you\" -\u003e \"the ideal version of you.\" \"Reverence the gods, save men\" -\u003e \"Respect the bigger picture, help people.\" \"Life is brief\" -\u003e keep it. \"Holy disposition and neighbourly acts\" -\u003e \"good character and helping others.\" Antoninus -\u003e use him as the \"role model.\" Describe his traits in relatable terms. \"Energy for reason\" -\u003e \"commitment to logic.\" \"Equability\" -\u003e \"calmness.\" \"Serene expression\" -\u003e \"kept his cool.\" \"Sweetness\" -\u003e \"decency.\" \"Disdain of glory\" -\u003e \"didn\u0027t chase fame.\" \"Ambition to grasp affairs\" -\u003e \"wanted to understand things properly.\" Thoroughness, patience, scrutiny -\u003e simplify. Contentment, work ethic, etc. -\u003e keep the essence. \"Conscience void of reproach\" -\u003e \"clear conscience.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Watch out you don\u0027t get power-hungry, turn into some Caesar-wannabe, get addicted to the status (\u0027dipped in purple\u0027). Keep it real: be simple, good, honest, serious, straightforward, a friend to justice, respectful of the bigger picture, kind, loving, strong enough for your actual work. Fight like hell to be the person Philosophy (your best self) wants you to be. Respect the natural order, help people out. Life\u0027s short; the real payoff is good character and decent actions. In everything, aim to be like Antoninus (your role model): dude was committed to rational action, always level-headed, calm, decent, ignored fame, really dug into understanding things. Never rushed, handled criticism without returning it, didn\u0027t listen to slander, carefully checked out people and situations, wasn\u0027t quick to blame, content with basics (lodging, clothes, food), hard-working, patient, consistent with friends, listened even to blunt opposition, respected the gods without being weird about it. Aim to reach your end with a clear conscience, just like him.\n\n    *   **VI.31 (Wake Up from Dreams):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Sober up, wake up from sleep/dreams. See reality clearly again, like you saw the dreams were just dreams.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Be sober once more\" -\u003e \"snap out of it,\" \"get clear-headed.\" \"Recall yourself\" -\u003e \"come back to yourself.\" \"Shake off sleep\" -\u003e \"wake the hell up.\" \"Dreams which troubled you\" -\u003e \"the illusions messing with you.\" \"Look at these things as you looked at those\" -\u003e \"see reality as clearly as you see dreams aren\u0027t real.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Snap out of it. Get clear-headed again, shake off the fog. Realize those worries and illusions messing with you were like bad dreams. Now that you\u0027re fully awake, look at reality clearly, just like you recognize dreams aren\u0027t real once you wake up.\n\n    *   **VI.32 (Body/Mind Indifference):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* I am body + spirit. Body is indifferent to externals (can\u0027t distinguish). Understanding is indifferent to non-mental activities. It controls its own activities, but only cares about the present one; past/future are also indifferent now.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Body and spirit\" -\u003e \"body and mind.\" \"Body... indifferent\" -\u003e \"your body doesn\u0027t care about externals, can\u0027t tell good/bad.\" \"Understanding... indifferent to non-mental activities\" -\u003e \"Your mind doesn\u0027t care about stuff outside its own thinking.\" \"Its own activities are in its control\" -\u003e \"It only controls its own thoughts/judgments.\" \"Concerned only about the present\" -\u003e \"focuses on the now.\" \"Future and past activities... indifferent\" -\u003e \"what\u0027s done is done, what\u0027s future isn\u0027t here yet – irrelevant to *this* moment\u0027s judgment.\"\n        *   *Draft:* I\u0027m made of body and mind. To my body, external events are all the same – it can\u0027t judge them. To my mind, anything that isn\u0027t its own activity (thinking, judging) is irrelevant. The mind controls its own actions. And even then, it\u0027s really only concerned with the present moment\u0027s activity. Past thoughts? Future plans? Those are also irrelevant *right now*.\n\n    *   **VI.33 (Pain Not Unnatural):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Hand/foot pain isn\u0027t unnatural if the hand/foot is doing its job. So, pain isn\u0027t unnatural for a man doing his job as a man. If not unnatural, it\u0027s not an evil for him.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Make the logic clearer. \"Pain of hand...\" -\u003e \"Pain in your hand or foot isn\u0027t \u0027against nature\u0027 if it comes from using them properly.\" \"Doing the service of a foot/hand\" -\u003e \"doing what feet/hands do.\" \"Pain... not contrary to Nature, while he is doing the service of a man\" -\u003e \"So, pain for a person living their life isn\u0027t \u0027unnatural\u0027 either.\" \"Neither is it an evil for him\" -\u003e \"And if it\u0027s not unnatural, it\u0027s not truly *bad* for your core self.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Pain in your hand or foot isn\u0027t automatically \u0027against nature\u0027 if it comes from the hand doing hand-stuff or the foot doing foot-stuff. So, pain for a human being, while doing human-stuff (living, working, striving), isn\u0027t against *your* nature either. And if it\u0027s not against your nature, it\u0027s not a true evil for *you*. It\u0027s just a physical event.\n\n    *   **VI.34 (Vicious Pleasures):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Look at the monstrous pleasures enjoyed by wicked people (brigands, perverts, murderers, tyrants).\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Keep it stark. List the types. \"Monstrous pleasures\" -\u003e \"fucked-up pleasures,\" \"twisted kicks.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Think about the fucked-up pleasures some people get off on – criminals, predators, murderers, tyrants. Gross. (Implied: Is *that* the kind of pleasure you want to chase?)\n\n    *   **VI.35 (Craftsmen vs. Man):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Craftsmen accommodate amateurs somewhat but stick to their craft\u0027s rules. Isn\u0027t it bad that architects/doctors respect their art\u0027s principles more than man respects his own (reason, shared with gods)?\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Craftsman analogy -\u003e \"skilled pros.\" \"Suit themselves up to a point to amateurs\" -\u003e \"might simplify things for newbies.\" \"Stick to the rule of their craft\" -\u003e \"never compromise their core standards.\" Architect/physician -\u003e keep as examples. \"Reverence... principle of his art\" -\u003e \"respect the rules of their profession.\" \"Man his own principle\" -\u003e \"you respecting your own core principle – reason.\" \"Common with the gods\" -\u003e \"shared with the highest potential.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Look how skilled pros work. They might accommodate newbies to a point, but they *always* stick to the fundamental rules of their craft. They don\u0027t compromise standards. Isn\u0027t it messed up, then, that an architect or a doctor respects the principles of their job more than the average person respects their *own* core principle – Reason, the thing we share with the highest intelligence?\n\n    *   **VI.36 (Cosmic Perspective):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Continents are corners, seas drops, mountains clods, time instants. All is petty, changing. All comes from the governing principle or follows it. Even harmful things (lion\u0027s jaws, poison, thistles) are by-products of higher principles. Don\u0027t see them as contrary; see the source.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Cosmic perspective -\u003e zoom out. \"Asia and Europe are corners\" -\u003e \"Continents are just tiny corners of the map.\" Keep the analogies (sea/drop, mountain/clod, time/pin-prick). \"Petty, easily changed, vanishing\" -\u003e \"small, temporary, fading.\" \"Come from that other world...\" -\u003e \"It all stems from the same source, the main governing logic.\" Harmful things as by-products -\u003e this is tricky. Maybe \"side effects\" or \"part of the package.\" \"August and lovely principles\" -\u003e \"the grand, awesome design.\" \"Don\u0027t... imagine them to be contrary\" -\u003e \"Don\u0027t think they\u0027re *against* the system you respect.\" \"Reflect upon the fountain\" -\u003e \"Look at the source of everything.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Zoom out. Europe and Asia? Just tiny corners of the universe. Every ocean? A single drop. Mount Athos? A speck of dust. Every moment? A pinprick in eternity. It\u0027s all small, constantly changing, disappearing. Everything comes from the same source, the universe\u0027s operating system, or follows from it. Even shitty things – lion\u0027s teeth, poison, thorns, swamps – they\u0027re like by-products of the bigger, awesome processes. Don\u0027t think of them as mistakes or contradictions to the system you respect. Instead, think about the single source from which *everything* arises.\n\n    *   **VI.37 (Seeing the Present is Seeing All):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Seeing the present is seeing everything, past and future, because all things are related and similar.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* This is a core Stoic idea about the cyclical nature or uniformity of experience. \"He who sees what is now has seen all things\" -\u003e \"If you truly understand the present, you understand the whole pattern.\" \"From everlasting... unto unlimited time\" -\u003e \"past, present, future.\" \"All things are of one kin and of one kind\" -\u003e \"It\u0027s all variations on the same themes.\"\n        *   *Draft:* If you really get what\u0027s happening *now*, you\u0027ve basically seen it all – everything that ever was, everything that ever will be. Why? Because it\u0027s all connected, all part of the same pattern, the same kind of stuff repeating.\n\n    *   **VI.38 (Interconnectedness):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Meditate on the bond and relationship of all things. They are interwoven, dear to each other, following in order due to movement, common spirit, and unified matter.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Bond of all... mutual relationship\" -\u003e \"how everything is connected.\" \"Woven together\" -\u003e \"interlinked.\" \"Dear to one another\" -\u003e \"belong together.\" \"Follow in order...\" -\u003e \"it all flows together because of the universe\u0027s energy, shared spirit, and the unity of all matter.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Think often about how everything in the universe is connected, how it all relates. Things are woven together, they belong together. One thing follows another logically because of the universe\u0027s energy, the shared spirit, and the fact that all matter is fundamentally one.\n\n    *   **VI.39 (Accept Your Lot):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Fit yourself to your circumstances and love the people your lot is cast with, truly.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Fit yourself into accord with the things...\" -\u003e \"Adapt to what life throws at you.\" \"Your portion has been cast\" -\u003e \"your specific situation.\" \"Love the men among whom your lot has fallen\" -\u003e \"Care about the people you have to deal with.\" \"But love them truly\" -\u003e \"Genuinely.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Adapt yourself to the circumstances you\u0027re dealt. And the people you find yourself with? Choose to care about them, genuinely.\n\n    *   **VI.40 (Inner Maker, Reverence):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Tools are good if they do their job; maker is outside. Naturally coherent things have the maker (power) within. Reverence this inner power. If you live by its will, all is to your mind, as the All\u0027s things are to its mind.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Tool analogy -\u003e keep it simple. Natural things -\u003e \"things that grow or exist naturally.\" \"Power which made them is within\" -\u003e \"the creative force is inside them.\" \"Reverence it the more\" -\u003e \"Respect that inner force even more.\" \"Live according to the will of that power\" -\u003e \"live according to nature/reason.\" \"You have all things to your mind\" -\u003e \"you\u0027ll be content,\" \"things will align for you internally.\" \"Its things are to the mind of the All\" -\u003e \"just like the universe is aligned with its own nature.\"\n        *   *Draft:* A tool or gadget works well if it does the job it was made for. But its maker is outside. With natural things (plants, animals, you), the power that made them is *inside*, part of them. Respect that inner power deeply. Believe that if you live according to its will (your rational nature), you\u0027ll find inner alignment and contentment. Things will be \"right\" for you internally, just as the universe\u0027s parts are \"right\" for the universe itself.\n\n    *   **VI.41 (Locating Good/Evil Internally):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* If you define external things as good/evil, you\u0027ll inevitably blame gods and hate people when things go wrong. If you locate good/evil only in your will/choices, there\u0027s no reason to blame God or hate others.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Propose... something beyond your will\" -\u003e \"decide that external stuff is \u0027good\u0027 or \u0027bad\u0027.\" \"Fall into that evil or fail of that good\" -\u003e \"when you don\u0027t get the \u0027good\u0027 or land in the \u0027bad\u0027.\" \"Blame the gods and you hate men\" -\u003e \"you\u0027ll end up blaming fate/luck and hating people.\" \"Decide that only what our will controls is good or evil\" -\u003e \"if you decide only your choices/judgments matter.\" \"No ground is left...\" -\u003e \"then there\u0027s no reason to bitch at the universe or resent people.\"\n        *   *Draft:* If you decide that external stuff (money, status, health) is the ultimate \u0027good\u0027 or \u0027bad,\u0027 you\u0027re setting yourself up. When you inevitably miss out on the \u0027good\u0027 or hit the \u0027bad,\u0027 you\u0027ll end up blaming the universe or fate, and hating people you think caused it. We do a lot of dumb shit because of this. BUT, if you decide that the *only* real good or bad is in what *you control* (your choices, your character), then there’s zero reason left to blame God/fate or to see other people as enemies.\n\n    *   **VI.42 (Working Together, Even Unknowingly):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* We all work together for one end, some knowingly, some not (like Heraclitus\u0027 \u0027sleepers\u0027). Even critics/resistors play a part. Find your place; the Universe will use you. Don\u0027t be the cheap, useless verse (Chrysippus).\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Working together to a single end\" -\u003e \"we\u0027re all part of the same big project.\" \"Consciously... without knowledge\" -\u003e \"some get it, some don\u0027t.\" Heraclitus\u0027 sleepers -\u003e \"even clueless people contribute.\" Critics/resistors -\u003e \"even the haters and obstacles have a role.\" \"Universe has need even for such a one\" -\u003e \"the system uses everyone.\" \"See with which you take your post\" -\u003e \"figure out where you fit in.\" \"Employ you aright\" -\u003e \"put you to good use.\" \"Mean a part as the cheap and ridiculous verse\" -\u003e \"don\u0027t be the useless, throwaway line.\"\n        *   *Draft:* We\u0027re all contributing to the same single outcome, whether we realize it or not. Like Heraclitus said, even sleepers are playing their part. Everyone helps somehow – even the guy who complains and tries to block things; the universe finds a use for him too. So, figure out your role and play it well. The system will use you regardless. Just don\u0027t be like that lame, pointless line in a bad play that Chrysippus mentioned – contribute something meaningful.\n\n    *   **VI.43 (Different Roles, Same Goal):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Does the Sun do the Rain\u0027s job? Does Aesculapius (healing) do the Fruit-goddess\u0027s job? Stars have different roles but work together.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Use modern role examples if needed, but Sun/Rain is clear. Aesculapius/Fruit -\u003e maybe \"Does the doctor try to be the farmer?\" Stars -\u003e good example. \"Different province, but working together\" -\u003e \"Different jobs, same team.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Does the Sun try to do the Rain\u0027s job? Does the god of healing try to do the job of the goddess of harvest? What about the stars? Each has a different task, right? But they all work together for the same overall system.\n\n    *   **VI.44 (Trusting Providence or Self-Counsel):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* If gods planned for me, they planned well (gods aren\u0027t purposeless or malicious). If they didn\u0027t plan for me individually, they planned for the common good, and I should accept my part. If they plan nothing (impious thought), I can still plan for myself based on my nature (reasonable, social). My city is Rome (duty) and the Universe (identity). What benefits these is my good.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* God/Providence -\u003e \"If there\u0027s a plan...\" \"Took counsel for good\" -\u003e \"it\u0027s a good plan.\" (Gods aren\u0027t idiots or assholes). If no individual plan -\u003e \"if it\u0027s just about the big picture...\" Accept consequences -\u003e \"I need to accept my role in that.\" If no plan at all -\u003e \"(which is hard to believe, otherwise why bother with religion/ethics?)\" \"I am able to take counsel about myself\" -\u003e \"I can still figure things out for myself.\" \"My nature is reasonable and social\" -\u003e \"based on my nature as a rational, social being.\" Rome/Universe -\u003e \"My immediate community vs. the whole world.\" \"What benefits these cities is alone my good\" -\u003e \"What\u0027s good for my communities is good for me.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Look, if the gods (or the Universe\u0027s logic) made a plan for me, it must be a good one. Why? Because it makes no sense for a higher power to be purposeless or just want to mess with me. What\u0027s the upside for them or the common good? Now, if they didn\u0027t plan for *me* specifically, they definitely planned for the *common good*, and my life follows from that plan, so I should embrace it. Okay, let\u0027s say (even though it feels wrong) they plan *nothing*. Fine. *I* can still plan for myself. I can figure out what\u0027s beneficial based on my own nature – which is rational and social. As \u0027Antoninus,\u0027 my city is Rome; as a human, my city is the world. So, whatever benefits these \u0027cities\u0027 is what\u0027s truly good for me.\n\n    *   **VI.45 (Benefit to Whole and Individual):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* What happens to the individual benefits the Whole (enough). Also, often what benefits one benefits others (using \u0027advantage\u0027 broadly for indifferent things).\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Befalls the individual is to the advantage of the Whole\" -\u003e \"Whatever happens to one part helps the whole system.\" \"This should be enough\" -\u003e \"That should be convincing enough.\" Watch carefully -\u003e \"pay attention.\" \"Advantages a man also advantages the rest\" -\u003e \"what helps one person often helps others too.\" Advantage broadly -\u003e \"this includes neutral stuff, not just ultimate good/evil.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Whatever happens to the individual part serves the whole system. That should be enough justification. But if you look closely, you\u0027ll often see that what benefits one person also tends to benefit others. (Here, \u0027benefit\u0027 can just mean neutral stuff happening, not ultimate moral good).\n\n    *   **VI.46 (Life\u0027s Repetitiveness):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Like amphitheater shows become boring due to repetition, so does life as a whole. Same things up and down. How long?\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Amphitheater -\u003e \"watching the same damn show,\" \"reruns.\" \"Similarity makes the spectacle nauseating\" -\u003e \"the repetition gets boring.\" \"Life as a whole\" -\u003e keep it. \"All things, up and down, are the same\" -\u003e \"same patterns, same cycles.\" \"How long will it last?\" -\u003e \"How long can this go on?\"\n        *   *Draft:* You know how watching the same show or game over and over gets boring? The repetition makes it nauseating. Life as a whole can feel like that too. Everything, the ups and downs, it\u0027s all the same stuff, from the same sources, just repeating. How much longer?\n\n    *   **VI.47 (Remembering the Dead, Valuing Truth):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Think of all kinds of dead people (specific names, then classes: orators, philosophers, heroes, kings, scientists, wits, mockers). They\u0027re all gone. Was it dreadful? What matters is living with truth, righteousness, and grace towards liars/unjust.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* List of names -\u003e maybe simplify or use modern archetypes? \"Orators, philosophers...\" -\u003e \"smart talkers, deep thinkers (like Heraclitus, Socrates), heroes, leaders, brilliant minds (scientists), witty guys, cynics (like Menippus).\" \"Laid in the ground\" -\u003e \"they\u0027re all dust now.\" \"Why was it dreadful?\" -\u003e \"Was it so bad for them?\" \"Whose names are not even remembered\" -\u003e emphasizes oblivion. \"One thing here is of great price\" -\u003e \"The only thing that truly matters here.\" \"Live out life with truth and righteousness...\" -\u003e \"live honestly and justly,\" \"be gracious even to assholes and liars.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Constantly remember all the people who\u0027ve died – every type, from every background. Think of the smooth talkers, the deep thinkers (Heraclitus, Socrates), the ancient heroes, the later kings and leaders. Think of the brilliant scientists (Archimedes), the sharp minds, the hard workers, the scammers, the stubborn ones, the cynics who mocked life itself (Menippus). Think: they\u0027re all long gone, turned to dust. Was it really so terrible for them in the end? What about all the ones whose names are forgotten? The *only* thing that has real value *here* is this: to live your life with truth and justice, and to be decent even to liars and unfair people.\n\n    *   **VI.48 (Cheer from Contemporaries\u0027 Virtues):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* To cheer yourself, think of the good qualities (merits) of people around you: energy, modesty, generosity, etc. Images of virtue are cheering. Keep them handy.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Cheer yourself\" -\u003e \"need a mood boost?\" \"Merits of those who are alive with you\" -\u003e \"good qualities of people you actually know.\" List examples -\u003e keep them clear. \"Energy,\" \"modesty,\" \"generosity.\" \"Images of the virtues shining\" -\u003e \"seeing good traits in action.\" \"Meeting... in a group\" -\u003e \"seeing them combined.\" \"Keep them ready to your hand\" -\u003e \"keep these examples in mind.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Need a pick-me-up? Think about the good qualities of the people around you right now. One person\u0027s drive, another\u0027s humility, someone else\u0027s generosity, whatever skills they have. Nothing cheers you up like seeing virtues in action in real people, especially when you see a bunch together. Keep those positive examples ready in your mind.\n\n    *   **VI.49 (Accepting Limits):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* You\u0027re not upset you don\u0027t weigh 300 pounds. You\u0027re not upset you won\u0027t live forever. Accept your allotted matter, accept your allotted lifespan.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Weight analogy -\u003e keep it. Lifespan -\u003e keep it. \"Contented with the quantity of matter\" -\u003e \"okay with the body you got.\" \"Contented with your days\" -\u003e \"be okay with the time you have.\"\n        *   *Draft:* You\u0027re not pissed off you don\u0027t weigh 300 pounds, right? Or that you won\u0027t live for 500 years? Just like you accept the physical body you were given, accept the lifespan you\u0027ve got. Be content with your allotment.\n\n    *   **VI.50 (Acting with Reservation):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Try to persuade others, but act justly even if they resist. If they use force, shift to acceptance/non-injury and use the obstacle to practice another virtue. Remember you aimed with a reservation (not at the impossible). Your reserved aim (acting virtuously despite obstacles) is achieved.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Endeavour to persuade them\" -\u003e \"Try to get them on board.\" \"Act even if they... unwilling\" -\u003e \"but do the right thing anyway.\" \"Rule of justice so directs\" -\u003e \"when justice demands it.\" Forceful resistance -\u003e \"If someone blocks you hard.\" \"Change your object to resignation...\" -\u003e \"switch your goal to acceptance and not getting bent out of shape.\" \"Use the opposition to elicit... a different virtue\" -\u003e \"use the obstacle as practice for patience, resilience, etc.\" Reservation -\u003e \"remember you aimed with an \u0027escape clause\u0027 – you weren\u0027t aiming for guaranteed success, just to *try* virtuously.\" \"What then was your aim?\" -\u003e \"So what *was* the goal?\" \"\u0027An aim qualified by a reservation.\u0027\" -\u003e \"To make the attempt virtuously.\" \"You do achieve this\" -\u003e \"You nailed that part.\" \"What we proposed... does come to pass\" -\u003e \"The internal goal was met.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Try to persuade people, sure. But do what\u0027s right *even if they refuse*, when justice demands it. If someone uses force to stop you, switch gears. Aim for acceptance and keeping your cool, not feeling personally wronged. Use their opposition as a chance to practice a different virtue (like patience or adaptability). Remember, you went into this with a \u0027reservation\u0027 – you weren\u0027t aiming at the *impossible* (forcing their agreement). What *was* your aim then? \u0027To act virtuously, attempting the goal.\u0027 And guess what? You *did* that. The real goal – the internal one – was achieved.\n\n    *   **VI.51 (Where People Locate Their Good):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Glory-lover thinks others\u0027 actions \u003d good. Pleasure-lover thinks own feeling \u003d good. Intelligent person thinks own action \u003d good.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Keep the distinctions clear. \"Glory lover\" -\u003e \"fame chaser.\" \"Activity of another\" -\u003e \"what others think/say.\" \"Pleasure lover\" -\u003e \"hedonist.\" \"Own feeling\" -\u003e \"their sensations.\" \"He who has intelligence\" -\u003e \"the rational person,\" \"the wise one.\" \"Own action\" -\u003e \"their own choices and actions.\"\n        *   *Draft:* The guy chasing fame thinks his \u0027good\u0027 comes from what *other people* do or say about him. The guy chasing pleasure thinks his \u0027good\u0027 is just his own *feelings*. The person with real intelligence? They know their \u0027good\u0027 lies in their *own actions*.\n\n    *   **VI.52 (Mind Creates Judgments):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* It\u0027s possible to have no opinion about something and not be troubled. Things themselves don\u0027t inherently create our judgments.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Entertain no thought about this\" -\u003e \"You don\u0027t *have* to have an opinion on this.\" \"Not to be troubled in spirit\" -\u003e \"and not let it mess with your head.\" \"Things of themselves are not so constituted...\" -\u003e \"Stuff doesn\u0027t automatically force you to judge it a certain way.\"\n        *   *Draft:* You can choose *not* to have an opinion about this, and not let it disturb your peace. Things themselves don\u0027t have the power to create your judgments about them. You do that.\n\n    *   **VI.53 (Understand the Speaker):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Train yourself to pay attention to what others say and try to understand their perspective (\u0027be in the mind of the speaker\u0027).\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Habituate yourself not to be inattentive\" -\u003e \"Make it a habit to actually listen.\" \"So far as possible, be in the mind of the speaker\" -\u003e \"Try your best to see where they\u0027re coming from.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Make it a habit: pay attention when someone else is talking. And as much as you can, try to get inside their head, understand their perspective.\n\n    *   **VI.54 (Hive and Bee):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* What doesn\u0027t benefit the hive doesn\u0027t benefit the bee.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Keep it concise. Hive -\u003e \"the team,\" \"the community,\" \"the company.\" Bee -\u003e \"the individual,\" \"you.\"\n        *   *Draft:* If it doesn\u0027t help the team (the hive), it doesn\u0027t help the individual player (the bee).\n\n    *   **VI.55 (Listen to Experts):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* If crew badmouths the captain or patients badmouth the doctor, who else would they listen to? How can the captain ensure safety or the doctor health then?\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Update the examples maybe? Captain/Crew -\u003e \"If players trash talk the coach.\" Doctor/Patients -\u003e keep it. \"Would they listen to anyone else?\" -\u003e \"Who are they gonna trust then?\" \"How should the master achieve safety...\" -\u003e \"How can the coach lead the team to win, or the doctor heal anyone?\" (Implication: Trust relevant expertise).\n        *   *Draft:* If the crew constantly trashes the captain, or patients badmouth the doctor, who the hell are they going to listen to? How can the captain keep the ship safe, or the doctor make anyone healthy, if no one trusts their judgment?\n\n    *   **VI.56 (Mortality Reminder):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* How many people I started life with are already gone!\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Keep it personal and stark. \"In whose company I came into the world\" -\u003e \"people born around the same time as me.\" \"Gone away already\" -\u003e \"already dead.\"\n        *   *Draft:* How many people who came into the world with me are already gone? Damn.\n\n    *   **VI.57 (Perception Alters Reality):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Honey tastes bitter to jaundiced. Water is feared by rabies victims. A ball seems great to kids. Why be angry at distorted perception? Misrepresentation is as powerful as bile or poison.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* Keep the examples. Jaundice/honey -\u003e \"Jaundice makes honey taste bitter.\" Rabies/water -\u003e \"Rabies makes people fear water.\" Ball/kids -\u003e \"A simple ball is amazing to a little kid.\" \"Why then am I angry?\" -\u003e \"So why do I get pissed off?\" \"Misrepresentation has smaller power...\" -\u003e \"Do you think faulty thinking (their wrong perception) is any less powerful than jaundice or rabies poison?\"\n        *   *Draft:* Honey tastes bitter to someone with jaundice. Someone with rabies dreads water. A little kid thinks a simple ball is the coolest thing ever. Their perception is altered. So why do *I* get angry when someone sees things wrongly? Do you really think their distorted view (their misinterpretation) has less power over *their* mind than jaundice or poison does over the body?\n\n    *   **VI.58 (Freedom Within Nature\u0027s Rules):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* No one can stop you living by your own nature\u0027s rule. Nothing will happen contrary to the Universal Nature\u0027s rule.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"Prevent your living by the rule of your own nature\" -\u003e \"stop you from living according to your own rational nature.\" \"Nothing will happen... contrary to the rule of Universal Nature\" -\u003e \"And nothing will happen to you that violates the rules of the overall universe.\"\n        *   *Draft:* Nobody can stop you from living according to the principles of your own nature (reason). And nothing will happen to you that goes against the laws of Universal Nature (how reality works).\n\n    *   **VI.59 (Consider Your Audience):**\n        *   *Original Idea:* Think about who these people are whose approval you seek, what results they admire, what actions they praise! How quickly eternity covers all, how much it has covered.\n        *   *Bro Conversion:* \"What creatures they are whom they wish to please\" -\u003e \"Who *are* these people you\u0027re trying so hard to impress?\" \"By what kind of results and actions\" -\u003e \"What kind of shallow crap do they value? What actions do they praise?\" Eternity -\u003e keep the perspective shift.\n        *   *Draft:* Think about who these people *are* that you\u0027re trying to please. What kind of results do they actually admire? What sort of actions do they praise? Seriously consider that. And remember how fast eternity swallows everything up, and how much it\u0027s already buried.\n\n4.  **Review and Refine:** Read through the entire \"Bro\" version.\n    *   Does it capture the core meaning of each section?\n    *   Is the tone consistent? (Informal, direct, practical, slightly irreverent but serious underneath).\n    *   Are the analogies clear and modern?\n    *   Does it flow well?\n    *   Is it *too* flippant in places, losing the philosophical weight? Adjust where needed. (e.g., ensure the translations don\u0027t become *just* cynical or dismissive, but retain the Stoic purpose).\n    *   Ensure the numbered structure matches the original. Add a title.\n\n5.  **Final Polish:** Check for typos, awkward phrasing. Make sure it sounds like a coherent piece, not just disjointed translations. Make sure the tone, while informal, still conveys Marcus Aurelius\u0027s seriousness of purpose.",

      "text": "Okay, cool. I get the vibe. You\u0027re taking the core Stoic ideas and making them sound more like straightforward, no-BS advice you\u0027d get from a sharp, grounded buddy. Less formal, more direct, maybe a bit more punchy.\n\nLet\u0027s apply that \"Bro\" translation style to Marcus Aurelius, Book VI.\n\n**HERE\u0027S THE \"BRO\" VERSION OF MEDITATIONS BOOK VI:**\n\n**THE UNIVERSE \u0026 YOUR PLACE IN IT (BOOK VI BRO-IFIED)**\n\n1.  **The System Isn\u0027t Out to Get You:** Look, the raw material of the universe? It’s flexible, workable. And the big Reason running the show? It doesn\u0027t *have* an evil bone in its body. It\u0027s not designed to screw things up or hurt anyone. Everything happens according to its logic. It just *is*.\n2.  **Just Do Your Job, Forget the Rest:** When you\u0027re focused on doing what you\u0027re supposed to be doing, who gives a damn if you\u0027re freezing or comfortable, dead tired or wide awake, getting trashed online or praised, dying or just chilling? Seriously, even the act of dying is just another part of life. So just handle *this moment* right. That’s plenty.\n3.  **See What It *Really* Is:** Look deeper. Don\u0027t let the real substance or the actual value of anything slip past you. See things for what they truly are, under the surface hype.\n4.  **Everything\u0027s Changing, Fast:** All this stuff around you? It’s gonna vanish quicker than you think. Maybe it all turns back into basic energy soup, maybe it breaks down into atoms. Point is, it\u0027s temporary. Don\u0027t cling.\n5.  **The System Knows Its Business:** That intelligence running the universe? It knows its own setup, what it creates, and the stuff it\u0027s working with. It’s got a handle on things.\n6.  **Best Revenge? Don\u0027t Be Like Them:** Want the ultimate payback against someone who wronged you? Simple: Don\u0027t become an asshole just like them.\n7.  **Find Your Flow in Helping Others:** Your real peace and purpose? Find it in doing one good, helpful action after another, staying connected to the bigger picture (the \u0027God\u0027 principle, the natural order, whatever you call it).\n8.  **Your Mind Calls the Shots:** Your own mind – your control center – is what wakes itself up, adapts, makes itself into what it wants to be, and frames *everything* that happens to you exactly how it chooses to see it. You control the internal narrative.\n9.  **It All Fits the Master Plan:** Everything unfolds according to the rules of the whole system. It’s not dictated by some rogue outside force or some random internal glitch. It’s all part of the one big flow.\n10. **Chaos or Order? Either Way, Act Right:** So, is the universe just a random jumble, atoms crashing and scattering? Or is there unity, order, maybe even a plan (Providence)? If it’s just chaos, why freak out? Why care about anything besides eventually turning back to dust? The scattering happens no matter what. But if there *is* order? Then chill out, trust the process, and find courage in the system. Either way, your job is to act rationally *now*.\n11. **Snap Back to Center:** When life inevitably throws you off balance and rattles your cage, get back to your core self – fast. Don\u0027t stay out of sync longer than needed. You regain control by constantly returning to that inner balance point.\n12. **Philosophy is Home Base:** Think of the daily grind, the demands of the world (\u0027the palace\u0027) like a step-mom you gotta deal with. Your philosophy, your principles? That’s your actual Mom, your home base. Keep going back there, recharge there. That’s what makes the daily grind tolerable, and makes *you* tolerable *in* it.\n13. **Strip Away the Hype:** Practice seeing fancy stuff for what it *really* is. That gourmet meal? Dead fish, dead bird, dead pig. That expensive wine? Fermented grape juice. That designer label? Sheep wool dyed with bug juice. Sex? Friction and messy biology. See the raw facts. Strip away the fancy labels and status games. Ego is a total bullshit artist – just when you think you’re being important and profound, you’re probably just buying into hype. (Like Crates said about that Xenocrates dude – even smart guys get fooled).\n14. **What *Real* People Admire:** Most folks admire basic stuff: possessions (rocks, wood), things that grow (figs, vines). Slightly more advanced folks admire things with \u0027life force\u0027: herds, power over slaves. Smarter still admire technical skill, being good *at* something. But the person who truly values Reason – rational, social intelligence? They stop caring about that other crap. They focus on keeping their *own* mind rational and contributing positively, working with others toward that goal.\n15. **Life\u0027s a Flow, Don\u0027t Cling:** Some things are just starting, others are ending, some are already gone while forming. Constant change keeps the world fresh, like time itself always moving. In this rushing river of existence, what specific thing flowing by is worth obsessing over? It’s like falling for a sparrow that flies past and is gone instantly. Your own life is just as fleeting – like breathing in, breathing out. You got this breath at birth, you give it back eventually. That\u0027s the whole cycle.\n16. **What\u0027s Actually Valuable? (Hint: Not Clapping):** Just breathing like an animal, reacting to senses, following urges, herding together, eating and shitting – that\u0027s not valuable. Getting applause? Likes? Empty praise? Nope, ditch that fake glory. So what *is* valuable? Acting purposefully, according to your rational human design. Like a craftsman makes something fit for its purpose, your purpose is to act rightly. That’s what real growth is about. Get that right, and you won\u0027t desperately need the other stuff. You’ll ditch envy, suspicion, scheming. Respecting your *own* mind, your reason – that makes you solid, connects you with others, and aligns you with reality (the gods).\n17. **Virtue Moves Differently:** Physical stuff moves predictably – up, down, circles. But human excellence, virtue? It moves on a higher level, a path that’s harder to map but ultimately gets you where you need to go.\n18. **The Absurdity of Posthumous Fame:** Isn\u0027t it weird how people trash-talk those around them now, but crave praise from people born later whom they\u0027ll never meet? That’s as logical as being sad that cavemen didn’t compliment your outfit. Pointless.\n19. **If It\u0027s Possible, It\u0027s Possible for You:** Don\u0027t assume something is impossible *for you* just because it feels hard right now. If it\u0027s something humans *can* generally do, and it\u0027s appropriate, then consider it within your reach too. Don’t write yourself off.\n20. **Treat Life\u0027s Fouls Like Sports Fouls:** In a game, someone might accidentally scratch you or bump you hard. You don\u0027t hold a lifelong grudge, right? You don\u0027t assume they\u0027re evil. Maybe you just keep a bit of distance, but good-naturedly. Do that in life. Overlook minor stuff from people who are basically your \u0027opponents\u0027 in the daily grind. You can avoid them without hating or suspecting them.\n21. **Be Glad to Be Proven Wrong:** If someone can logically show you that you’ve made a mistake in thought or action, be *glad* to change. You\u0027re after the truth, right? Truth never hurt anyone. Staying stuck in your own bullshit and ignorance? *That\u0027s* what hurts.\n22. **My Job is My Focus:** Let me just do my duty. Everything else is noise. It’s either lifeless stuff, an irrational animal, or someone who’s lost and doesn’t know the way.\n23. **Handle Everything Appropriately:** Use animals and objects rationally and fairly – you have reason, they don\u0027t. Treat other people decently, as fellow rational beings. And always keep the big picture principles in mind (call on the gods). Don\u0027t sweat how long you do this – even three hours lived right is solid.\n24. **Death: The Great Equalizer:** Alexander the Great and his stable boy? Ended up exactly the same after death. Either reabsorbed into the universe or scattered into atoms. Same destination.\n25. **Zoom Out: See the Simultaneous Action:** Think about all the stuff happening in your body and mind *right now*, all at once. Now scale that up. You won\u0027t be shocked that countless things are happening simultaneously across the whole universe, all part of one unified system.\n26. **Break It Down, Stay Calm:** If someone asks you how to spell \u0027Antoninus\u0027, you don\u0027t yell. You calmly list the letters: A-N-T-O... Do the same with your duties. They have steps. Know the steps, stick to them calmly. If people push back or get difficult, don\u0027t get sucked into their drama. Just methodically finish what you set out to do.\n27. **Teach, Don\u0027t Just Rage:** It’s wrong to stop people from going after what *they think* is good for them. When you just get pissed off because they screw up, you\u0027re kinda doing that. They\u0027re acting based on *their* flawed view of what\u0027s beneficial. Okay, so they\u0027re wrong? Fine. *Teach them*. Show them the better way. Don\u0027t just stand there indignant.\n28. **Death is Just Hitting Pause:** Death means rest – from constant sensory input, from being jerked around by impulses, from overthinking everything, and from the body’s endless demands.\n29. **Mind Over Body, Always:** It\u0027s pathetic if your mind gives up before your body does. Your body can endure a lot; don\u0027t let your spirit be the first to tap out.\n30. **Be Good, Not Caesar; Follow the Role Model (Antoninus):** Watch out you don\u0027t get corrupted by power or status – don\u0027t become a \u0027Caesar,\u0027 get \u0027dipped in purple.\u0027 Keep it real: simple, good, straight-up, serious, fair, respectful of the bigger picture, kind, solid, strong enough for the job. Fight to be the person your rational self (Philosophy) wants you to be. Respect reality, help people. Life\u0027s short; the only real win is good character and helping others. Be like Antoninus: committed to reason, always steady, calm, decent, ignored fame, dug deep to understand things. He wasn\u0027t rushed, took criticism without hitting back, ignored slander, checked things out thoroughly, wasn\u0027t blaming, suspicious, or pretending to be wise. Content with basics, worked hard, patient. Solid with friends, tolerated blunt disagreement, happy if someone showed a better way. Respected the divine order without superstition. Aim to die with a clear conscience like him.\n31. **Wake Up! It Was Just a Dream:** Snap out of the mental fog. Wake up fully. Realize those things troubling you were just illusions, like bad dreams. Now that you\u0027re awake, see *reality* clearly, just like you see dreams aren\u0027t real.\n32. **Mind Controls Judgment, Body Doesn\u0027t Care:** I\u0027m body and mind. Externals don\u0027t matter to the body – it can\u0027t judge them. Things outside the mind\u0027s own activity (thinking, judging) don\u0027t matter to the mind. It controls its own judgments. And really, it only cares about the *present* judgment. Past/future judgments are irrelevant right now.\n33. **Pain Isn\u0027t \u0027Unnatural\u0027 if You\u0027re Living:** Pain in your foot from walking isn\u0027t against nature; that\u0027s what feet do. So, pain for a human living a human life isn\u0027t \u0027against nature\u0027 either. And if it\u0027s not unnatural, it\u0027s not a true evil *for you*. It\u0027s just... pain.\n34. **Look at Who Enjoys *That* Stuff:** Think about the twisted kicks criminals, abusers, murderers, and tyrants get. Is *that* the kind of \u0027pleasure\u0027 worth chasing?\n35. **Respect Your Craft (Reason) Like a Pro:** Skilled craftsmen might adapt for amateurs, but they never abandon the core principles of their trade. Isn\u0027t it messed up that an architect or doctor respects their professional rules more than the average person respects their own core principle – Reason, the highest thing we\u0027ve got?\n36. **Cosmic Zoom-Out (Again):** Continents? Corners of the map. Oceans? Drops. Mountains? Clods. Time? Pinpricks. It\u0027s all tiny, changing, fading. Everything stems from the same universal source/logic. Even nasty stuff (poison, predators, swamps) are just by-products of the bigger, awesome system. Don\u0027t think they\u0027re *against* the system; see them as part of the whole picture originating from the single source.\n37. **Understand Now, Understand Always:** If you truly get the patterns of what\u0027s happening *now*, you\u0027ve basically seen it all – past, present, future. It\u0027s all variations on the same fundamental themes.\n38. **Everything\u0027s Connected:** Keep thinking about how everything in the universe is linked, related. It\u0027s all woven together, part of one system, following logical sequences driven by cosmic energy, shared spirit, and the unity of all matter.\n39. **Adapt and Care:** Fit yourself to your actual circumstances. And the people you\u0027re stuck with? Choose to genuinely care about them.\n40. **The Maker Within:** A tool works well if it does its job, but its maker is outside. With natural things (like you), the power that made them is *inside*. Respect that inner power (Reason). Live according to its will, and you\u0027ll find inner alignment and contentment, just like the universe is aligned with its own nature.\n41. **Internal Scoreboard Only:** If you decide external stuff is \u0027good\u0027 or \u0027bad,\u0027 you\u0027ll inevitably blame fate and hate people when things go wrong. If you decide the *only* real good/bad is in your choices and character, you\u0027ve got no reason to bitch about the universe or resent anyone.\n42. **We\u0027re All on the Team (Even the Sleepwalkers):** We\u0027re all working together towards one big outcome, whether we know it or not. Even the clueless \u0027sleepers,\u0027 even the critics and roadblocks – the universe uses them all. Figure out your role and play it well. Don\u0027t be the useless, throwaway part.\n43. **Different Jobs, Same Goal:** Does the Sun try to do the Rain\u0027s job? Does the healing god try to grow crops? Stars have different roles, but they all work together, right? Same principle applies everywhere.\n44. **Trust the Plan (or Trust Yourself):** If the universe/gods planned for me, it\u0027s a good plan (they aren\u0027t stupid or mean). If they only planned for the common good, my life follows from that, so I accept it. If they planned nothing (doubtful), *I* can still plan for myself based on my rational, social nature. My duty is to my community (Rome) and to humanity (the Universe). What helps them, helps me.\n45. **What Helps the Whole, Helps the Part:** Whatever happens to you serves the larger system. That should be enough. But often, what benefits one person also benefits others too (even in neutral ways).\n46. **Same Shit, Different Day (But Perspective Helps):** Like watching endless reruns gets boring, life\u0027s cycles can feel repetitive. Same ups, same downs, same sources. How long does this go on? (The implication: Find meaning not in novelty, but in your response).\n47. **Remember the Dead, Live for Truth Now:** Think constantly about everyone who\u0027s died – all types, all nations. Famous orators, deep thinkers (Socrates), heroes, kings, brilliant scientists, witty guys, cynics (Menippus). They\u0027re all dust. Was death itself so awful for them? Or for the totally forgotten? The *only* thing valuable *now* is living with truth and justice, and being decent even to dishonest or unfair people.\n48. **Get a Boost from Good People:** Need to cheer up? Focus on the good qualities you see in people around you *now*: one person\u0027s energy, another\u0027s kindness, another\u0027s skill. Seeing virtues in action is genuinely uplifting. Keep those examples handy.\n49. **Accept Your Portion:** You\u0027re not mad you don\u0027t weigh 500 lbs, right? Or that you won\u0027t live 1000 years? Accept the body you have, accept the lifespan you have. Be content with your allocated slice.\n50. **Try, Adapt, Internal Win:** Try to persuade others. But do what\u0027s right *anyway*, even if they resist, if justice requires it. If they block you forcefully, shift your goal: aim for acceptance and keeping your cool. Use their opposition as practice for another virtue (patience, creativity). Remember you aimed with a \u0027reservation\u0027 – not guaranteeing external success, but aiming to act virtuously *in the attempt*. That internal goal? You achieved it. What you set out to do *internally* happened.\n51. **Where\u0027s Your \u0027Good\u0027 Located?:** The fame-chaser thinks his good comes from *others\u0027* activity (their praise). The pleasure-seeker thinks his good is his *own feelings*. The intelligent person knows their good is their *own action*.\n52. **You Don\u0027t *Have* to Judge:** You can choose to have no opinion on this external thing, and keep your peace. Things themselves don\u0027t force your judgments onto you.\n53. **Listen to Understand:** Make it a real habit: pay attention to what someone else says. Try hard to get inside their perspective.\n54. **Team First:** What doesn\u0027t benefit the whole hive doesn\u0027t benefit the individual bee. What\u0027s bad for the community is bad for you.\n55. **Trust the Experts (or Who Will You Trust?):** If the sailors constantly diss the captain, or patients diss the doctor, who *are* they going to listen to? How can the captain keep the ship safe, or the doctor heal anyone, without trust?\n56. **They\u0027re Gone Already:** Damn. How many people who started out life around the same time as me are already dead? (A mortality check).\n57. **Perception is Reality (For Them):** Jaundice makes honey taste bad. Rabies makes you fear water. A ball is amazing to a kid. Their perception is warped. So why get angry when someone *else\u0027s* perception is warped by bad judgment or ignorance? Do you think faulty thinking is less powerful than poison?\n58. **Your Inner Freedom is Secure:** Nobody can stop you from living according to your own rational nature. And nothing will happen to you that violates the fundamental laws of the universe.\n59. **Seriously, *Who* Are You Trying to Impress?:** Think about the actual people whose approval you crave. What shallow results and actions do *they* value? And remember how fast eternity covers everything, and how much it\u0027s already covered. Is their fleeting opinion worth compromising for?",

      "text": "BOOK VII\n\n1. This is Evil; it is that which you have often seen. Have this ready to hand at every emergency, that this is what you have often seen. You will in general find the same things repeated up and down the world. The ancient chronicles are full of them, those of the middle age, the recent. Cities and households to-day are full of them. There is nothing new, all alike familiar and short-lived.\n\n2. Your principles are living principles. How else can they become lifeless, except the images which tally with them be extinguished? And with you it lies to rekindle them constantly. \u0027I am able to think as I ought about this; if, then, I am able, why am I troubled? Things outside my understanding are nothing at all in regard to my understanding.\u0027 Master this, and you stand upright. To come back to life is in your power; look once more at things as once you did, for herein to come back to life consists.\n\n3. A procession\u0027s vain pomp, plays on a stage, flocks, herds, sham fights, a bone thrown to puppies, a crumb into fishponds, toiling and moiling of ants carrying their loads, scurrying of startled mice, marionettes dancing to strings. Well, then, you must stand up in all this, kindly and not carrying your head proudly; yet understand that every man is worth just so much as the worth of what he has set his heart upon.\n\n4. In conversation one ought to follow closely what is being said; in the field of impulse to follow what is happening; in the latter case to see immediately what is the object of reference, in the former to mark closely the meaning expressed.\n\n5. Is my understanding sufficient for this or not? If it is sufficient, I employ it for the task as an instrument bestowed on me by Universal Nature. But if it is insufficient, either I withdraw from the task in favour of one who can accomplish it better (provided in other ways this is my duty), or else I do it as best I can, taking to help me one who by using my intelligence to assist him can do what is now opportune and beneficial for the general public. For whatever I do, by myself or with another, should contribute solely to this, the general benefit and harmony.\n\n6. How many whose praises have been loudly sung are now committed to oblivion: how many who sang their praises are long ago departed.\n\n7. Do not be ashamed to be helped; the task before you is to accomplish what falls to your lot, like a soldier in a storming-party. Suppose you are lame and cannot scale the wall by yourself, yet it can be done with another\u0027s help.\n\n8. Let not the future trouble you; for you will come to it, if come you must, bearing with you the same reason which you are using now to meet the present.\n\n9. All things are woven together and the common bond is sacred, and scarcely one thing is foreign to another, for they have been arranged together in their places and together make the same ordered Universe. For there is one Universe out of all, one God through all, one substance and one law, one common Reason of all intelligent creatures and one truth, if indeed the perfection of creatures of the same family and partaking of the same Reason is one.\n\n10. Everything material vanishes very swiftly in the Universal Substance, every cause is very swiftly taken up into the Universal Reason, and the memorial of everything is very swiftly buried in eternity.\n\n11. For a reasonable creature the same act is according to Nature and according to Reason.\n\n12. Upright, or held upright.\n\n13. Reasonable beings, constituted for one fellowship of co-operation, are in their separated bodies analogous to the several members of the body in individual organisms. The idea of this will come home to you more if you say to yourself: \u0027I am a member of the system made up of reasonable beings.\u0027 If, however, by the change of one letter, you call yourself a part, you do not yet love men from your heart; well-doing is not yet a joy to you for its own sake; you are still doing it as a bare duty, not yet as though doing good to yourself.\n\n14. Let what will from outside happen to what can be affected by this happening, for the parts which are affected shall, if they please, find fault; whereas I myself, unless I conceive the accident to be evil, am not yet harmed; and it is in my power not to conceive it to be evil.\n\n15. Whatever any one may do or say, I am bound to be good; exactly as if gold or emerald or purple were continually to say this: \u0027whatever any one may do or say, I am bound to be an emerald and to keep the colour that is mine\u0027.\n\n16. The governing self does not create disorder for itself; I mean, for instance, it does not alarm itself or (lead itself)[1] to appetite. If, however, any one else can alarm it or give it pain, let him do so, for it will not itself, with the consent of its judgement, turn to such moods. Let the body, if it can, be careful itself to suffer nothing; and the vital spirit which entertains fear and grief, if it suffers anywhere, let it say that it does; but that which delivers judgement generally on these affections will not suffer, for it will not itself be hasty to deliver such a judgement. The governing power regarded by itself has no wants, unless it create want for itself, and in the same way it is untroubled and unhindered, unless it trouble and hinder itself.\n\n17. Happiness is a good genius or a good familiar spirit. \u0027What then are you doing here, phantom of imagination? Depart, in God\u0027s name, the way you came; I have no need of you. But you have come according to your ancient habit. I am not angry with you, only depart.\u0027\n\n18. Is it change that a man fears? Why, what can have come to be without change, and what is dearer or more familiar to Universal Nature? Can you yourself take your bath, unless the firewood changes? Can you be nourished, unless what you eat changes? Can any other service be accomplished without change? Do you not see that it is precisely your changing which is similar, and similarly necessary to Universal Nature?\n\n19. Through the matter of the Whole, as through a winter torrent, all bodies are passing, connatural with the Whole and co-operating with it, as our members work with one another. How many a Chrysippus, a Socrates, an Epictetus has Eternity already sucked down! Let the same thought strike you in the case of any single individual or object.\n\n20. One thing only troubles me, that I may not myself do something which the constitution of man does not intend, or in the way it does not intend, or which at this moment it does not intend.\n\n21. Near at hand is your forgetting all; near, too, all forgetting you.\n\n22. It is a property of man to love even those who stumble. This feeling ensues if it occur to you at the time that men are your kindred and go wrong because of ignorance and against their will; that in a little while both of you will be dead; but, above all, that he did you no harm, for he did not make your governing self worse than it was before.\n\n23. Universal Nature out of its whole material, as from wax, models now the figure of a horse, then melting this down uses the material for a tree, next for a man, next for something else. And these, every one, subsist for a very brief while. Yet it is no hardship for a box to be broken up, as it was none for it to be nailed together.\n\n24. A scowl on the face is eminently against Nature and, whenever it is often repeated, the expression dies or is at last extinguished, so that it loses the power to light up again. . . .[2] Try to understand this very point that it is against Reason. For if even the consciousness of doing wrong has gone, what ground for living is left?\n\n25. Everything that your eyes look upon will be changed almost in a moment by Nature which orders the Whole, and out of the material it will create other things, and again out of their material others, in order that the world may be ever fresh and young.\n\n26. When a man offends against you, think at once what conception of good or ill it was which made him offend. And, seeing this, you will pity him, and feel neither surprise nor anger. For you yourself still conceive either the same object as he does to be good, or something else of the same type; you are bound, therefore, to excuse him. If, on the other hand, you no longer conceive things of that kind to be goods or ills, you will the more easily be kind to one whose eye is darkened.\n\n27. Do not think of what are absent as though they were now existing, but ponder on the most fortunate of what you have got, and on account of them remind yourself how they would have been missed, if they had not been here. Take heed at the same time not to accustom yourself to overvalue the things you are thus contented to have, so as to be troubled if at any time they are not here.\n\n28. Withdraw into yourself: the reasonable governing self is by its nature content with its own just actions and the tranquillity it thus secures.\n\n29. Wipe away the impress of imagination. Stay the impulse which is drawing you. Define the time which is present. Recognize what is happening to yourself or another. Divide and separate the event into its causal and material aspects. Dwell in thought upon your last hour. Leave the wrong done by another where the wrong arose.\n\n30. Direct your thought to what is being said. Let your mind gain an entrance into what is occurring and who is producing it.\n\n31. Make yourself glad in simplicity, self-respect, and indifference to what lies between virtue and vice. Love mankind. Follow God. Democritus says: \u0027All (sensibles) are ruled by law, but in reality the elements alone exist.\u0027 Enough for you to remember that \u0027all exist by law\u0027; now is there very little else.[3]\n\n32. On Death: either dispersal, if we are composed of atoms; or if we are a living unity, either extinction or a change of abode.\n\n33. On Pain: what we cannot bear removes us from life; what lasts can be borne. The understanding, too, preserves its own tranquillity by abstraction, and the governing self does not grow worse; but it is for the parts which are injured by the pain, if they can, to declare it.\n\n34. On Fame: see what their minds are like, what they avoid, what pursue. And, besides, that as the sands are constantly carried over one another, hiding what went before, so in our life what was before is very swiftly hidden by what is carried after.\n\n35. \u0027Do you really imagine that an intelligence endowed with greatness of heart and a vision of all time and all reality thinks this mortal life to be a great thing?\u0027 \u0027Impossible\u0027, was his answer. \u0027Then such a man as that will consider even death not a thing to be dreaded, will he not?\u0027 \u0027Most assuredly.\u0027\n\n36. \u0027A King\u0027s part: to do good and to be reviled.\u0027\n\n37. It is absurd that a man\u0027s expression should obey and take a certain shape and fashion of beauty at the bidding of the mind, whereas the mind itself is not shaped and fashioned to beauty by itself.\n\n38. \u0027Man must not vent his passion on dead things,\nSince they care nothing. . . .\u0027\n\n39. \u0027May it be joy that you give to the immortal gods and to men.\u0027\n\n40. \u0027Life, like ripe corn, must to the sickle yield,\nAnd one must be, another cease to be.\u0027\n\n41. \u0027Were the gods careless of my sons and me,\nYet there is reason here.\u0027\n\n42. \u0027For with me stand both Righteousness and Good.\u0027\n\n43. \u0027Mourn not with them that sorrow; feel no thrill.\u0027\n\n44. \u0027But I should have a right answer to give him, as follows: \"You speak unadvisedly, my friend, if you fancy that a man who is worth anything ought to take the risk of life or death into account, and not to consider only one thing, when he is acting, whether he does what is right or wrong, the actions of a good man or a bad.\"\u0027\n\n45. \u0027For really and truly, men of Athens, the matter stands like this: wherever a man takes post, believing it to be the best, or is posted by his captain, there he ought, as I think, to remain and abide the risk, taking into account nothing, whether death or anything else, in comparison with dishonour.\u0027\n\n46. \u0027But consider, my friend, whether possibly high spirit and virtue are not something other than saving one\u0027s life and being saved. Perhaps a man who is really a man must leave on one side the question of living as long as he can, and must not love his life, but commit these things to God, and, believing the women\u0027s proverb that no one ever escaped his destiny, must consider, with that in his mind, how he may live the best possible life in the time that is given him to live.\u0027\n\n47. Watch and see the courses of the stars as if you ran with them, and continually dwell in mind upon the changes of the elements into one another; for these imaginations wash away the foulness of life on the ground.\n\n48. Moreover, when discoursing about mankind, look upon earthly things below as if from some place above them—herds, armies, farms, weddings, divorces, births, deaths, noise of law courts, lonely places, divers foreign nations, festivals, mournings, market places, a mixture of everything and an order composed of contraries.\n\n49. Behold the past, the many changes of dynasties; the future, too, you are able to foresee, for it will be of like fashion, and it is impossible for the future to escape from the rhythm of the present. Therefore to study the life of man for forty years is no different from studying it for a hundred centuries. For what more will you see?\n\n50. \u0027The earth-born parts return to earth again,\nBut what did blossom of ethereal seed\nReturns again to the celestial pole.\u0027\nOr else this: an undoing of the interlacement of the atoms and a similar shattering of the senseless molecules.\n\n51. \u0027With gifts of meat and drink and magic charms\nTurning aside the current not to die.\u0027\n\n\u0027Man must endure whatever wind doth blow\nFrom God, and labour still without lament.\u0027\n\n52. \u0027A better man at wrestling\u0027: but not more sociable or more modest or better trained to meet occasion or kinder to the faults of neighbours.\n\n53. Where work can be accomplished according to the reason which is common to gods and men, there is nothing to fear; for where it is possible to obtain benefit by action which moves on an easy path and according to your constitution, there is no injury to suspect.\n\n54. Everywhere and continually it is in your power to be reverently content with your present circumstance, to behave to men who are present with you according to right and to handle skilfully the present impression, that nothing you have not mastered may cross the threshold of the mind.\n\n55. Do not look round to the governing selves of men different from yourself, but keep looking straight forward to the goal to which Nature is leading you, Universal Nature through what befalls you, and your own nature by what has to be done by yourself. Now each must do what follows from its constitution, and while the other creatures are constituted for the sake of the reasonable (just as in all else the inferior are for the sake of the superior), the reasonable are for one another\u0027s sake. Thus the principal end in man\u0027s constitution is the social; and the second, to resist the passions of the body; for it is a property of reasonable and intelligent movement to limit itself and never to be worsted by movements of sense or impulse; for each of those belong to the animal in us, but the movement of intelligence resolves to be sovereign and not to be mastered by those movements outside itself. And rightly so, for that is constituted by Nature to make use of them. The third end in a reasonable constitution is to avoid rash judgement and not to be deceived. Let the governing self, therefore, hold fast to these, and progress on a straight path, and it possesses what is its own.\n\n56. As though you were now dead and have not lived your life up to the present moment, use the balance remaining to live henceforward according to Nature.\n\n57. Love only what falls to your lot and is destined for you; what is more suited to you than that?\n\n58. On each occurrence keep before your eyes those to whom the same happened, and then they were sorry, were surprised, complained. And now where are they? Nowhere. Very well, do you, too, desire what they desired? Will you not leave the moods of others to those who shift their moods and are shifted, and yourself be entirely concerned with the way to treat them? For you will treat them well and they will be material for yourself; only attend and resolve to be fair to yourself in all that you do, and call both things to your mind that what you do is important and that it is unimportant in what sphere your action lies.[4]\n\n59. Delve within; within is the fountain of good, and it is always ready to bubble up, if you always delve.\n\n60. The body, too, should be composed, not sprawling about, whether in motion or in repose. For we should require of the body as a whole just what the mind exhibits in the face, when it preserves it intelligent and comely. But all these precautions must be adopted without affectation.\n\n61. The art of living resembles wrestling more than dancing, in as much as it stands prepared and unshaken to meet what comes and what it did not foresee.\n\n62. Constantly stop and consider the manner of men these are whose testimony you desire to gain, and their ruling principles; for, if you look into the sources of their judgement and impulse, you will not blame those who stumble involuntarily nor will you invite their testimony to yourself.\n\n63. \u0027No soul is willing to be robbed of truth\u0027, he says. The same holds of justice, too, of temperance, of kindness, and the like. It is most necessary to remember this continually, for thus you will be more gentle to all men.\n\n64. In the case of every pain be ready with the reflection that it is not an evil, and does not injure the intelligence at the helm; for it does not destroy it, in so far as the soul is reasonable and social. In the case of most pains, however, the saying of Epicurus should help you: \u0027Pain is neither intolerable nor continuing, provided you remember its limits and do not let your imagination add to it\u0027. Remember, too, that many disagreeable feelings are identical with pain, and yet we do not perceive that they are; drowsiness, for example, and extreme heat, and loss of appetite. Whenever, then, you are disgusted in one or other of these ways, say to yourself: \u0027you are giving in to pain\u0027.\n\n65. See that you do not feel to the inhuman what they feel to mankind.\n\n66. How do we know that Telauges was not in character superior to Socrates? It is not enough that Socrates won more glory by his death, argued more fluently with the Sophists, spent the whole frosty night in the open with more endurance, thought it braver to refuse, when ordered to arrest Leo of Salamis, and \u0027carried his head high in the streets\u0027 (a trait in regard to which one might question whether it was true). No, we have to consider this: what kind of soul Socrates had, whether he could be content with being just in his dealings with men and righteous in his dealing with the gods, whether he was neither hastily indignant with wickedness nor a servant to any man\u0027s ignorance, whether he neither accepted as unfamiliar anything assigned by Universal Nature or endured it as intolerable, nor submitted his mind to be affected by the affections of the flesh.\n\n67. Nature did not so blend you with the compound Whole that she did not permit you to circumscribe yourself and to bring what is its own into submission to itself. Always bear this in mind, and further that to live the blessed life rests upon very few conditions; and do not, just because you have abandoned hope of being a thinker and a student of science, on this account despair of being free, modest, sociable, and obedient to God; for it is possible to become an entirely godlike man and yet not to be recognized by any one.\n\n68. Live out your life without restraint in entire gladness even if all men shout what they please against you, even if wild beasts tear in pieces the poor members of this lump of matter that has hardened about you. For, in the midst of all this, what hinders the mind from preserving its own self in tranquillity, in true judgement about what surrounds it and ready use of what is submitted to it, so that judgement says to what befalls it: \u0027this is what you are in reality, even if you seem other in appearance\u0027, and use says to what is given to it: \u0027I was looking for you, for the present is to me always material of reasonable and political virtue, that is (generally speaking) of the art of man or God\u0027; since whatever comes to pass is suited to God or man, and is neither novel nor hard to deal with, but familiar and easy to handle.\n\n69. Perfection of character possesses this: to live each day as if the last, to be neither feverish nor apathetic, and not to act a part.\n\n70. The gods, who have no part in death, are not grieved because in so long an eternity they will be obliged always and entirely to suffer so many and such worthless men; and besides they take care of them in all kinds of ways. Yet do you, who are all but at the point of vanishing, give up the struggle, and that though you are one of the worthless?\n\n71. It is ridiculous not to flee from one\u0027s own wickedness, which is possible, but to flee from other men\u0027s wickedness, which is impossible.\n\n72. Whatever the reasonable and political faculty discovers to be neither intelligent nor social, with good reason it decides to be beneath itself.\n\n73. When you have done good and another has been its object, why do you require a third thing besides, like the foolish—to be thought to have done good or to get a return?\n\n74. No one wearies of receiving benefits, and to benefit another is to act according to Nature. Do not weary then of the benefits you receive by the doing of them.",

      "text": "The user wants me to take Book VII of Marcus Aurelius\u0027 Meditations and rewrite it in the \"Bro\" style I established earlier with the Enchiridion and Meditations Book VI.\n\n**Key elements of the \"Bro\" style:**\n*   Direct, no-nonsense language.\n*   Modern, informal vocabulary and phrasing.\n*   Focus on practical application and core meaning.\n*   Slightly punchier, maybe a bit blunt.\n*   Less philosophical jargon, more straightforward advice.\n*   Use of analogies and metaphors that resonate today.\n*   Short, impactful sentences sometimes.\n*   Maintain the core Stoic concepts (control vs. externals, acceptance, reason, duty, social connection, mortality awareness).\n\n**Plan for Book VII:**\nGo through each numbered point of the original text and translate it into the \"Bro\" style, keeping the meaning intact but changing the tone and language.\n\n1.  **Evil is Repetitive:** \"Seen this before.\" History, news, personal life – same patterns of messed-up behavior. Nothing new, just temporary drama.\n2.  **Principles Need Practice:** Your core beliefs aren\u0027t dead unless you let the thinking behind them fade. Reignite them. \"Can I think straight about this? Yes? Then why worry? Stuff outside my head doesn\u0027t control my head.\" Get this, you\u0027re solid. Bouncing back is possible. See things clearly again – *that\u0027s* coming back to life.\n3.  **Life\u0027s Spectacle:** Fancy parades, stage plays, animals, fights, scraps thrown around, ants busy as hell, scared mice, puppets – life\u0027s full of noise and show. Stand solid in it, be kind, don\u0027t get arrogant. Remember: a person\u0027s worth is tied to what they *actually* care about.\n4.  **Pay Attention:** In conversation, listen hard to what\u0027s *really* being said. When acting, focus on what\u0027s *actually* happening and why. See the cause, grasp the meaning.\n5.  **Know Your Limits, Use Your Tools:** Got the brainpower for this task? Good, use it – it\u0027s a tool Nature gave you. Not enough? Either step aside for someone better (if that\u0027s the right move), or do your best *with help*. Team up if it serves the common good. Whatever you do, alone or together, make sure it helps everyone and fits the bigger picture.\n6.  **Fame Fades:** Lots of famous people are forgotten. Lots of their praisers are long dead too. So much for legacy.\n7.  **It\u0027s Okay to Need Help:** No shame in getting backup. Your mission is to do your job, like a soldier taking a wall. Lame leg? Can\u0027t climb alone? Fine, get a boost from someone else. Mission accomplished.\n8.  **Don\u0027t Sweat the Future:** Stop worrying about what\u0027s coming. If you get there, you\u0027ll handle it with the same reason you\u0027re using *right now*. You\u0027ve got the tools already.\n9.  **Everything\u0027s Connected:** It\u0027s all woven together. One universe, one underlying reality (God/Nature), one set of rules, one common Reason we all tap into, one truth. We\u0027re all part of the same team.\n10. **Stuff Disappears, Causes Merge, Memory Fades:** Physical things vanish into cosmic dust fast. Causes get absorbed into the Big Picture quickly. Memories get buried by time even faster.\n11. **Rational \u003d Natural:** For a thinking creature, acting rationally *is* acting naturally.\n12. **Stand Tall (Or Be Held Tall):** Stay upright, either by your own strength or by sticking to your principles.\n13. **We\u0027re All Parts of a Whole:** Think of humanity like limbs of one body. Better yet, say \"I am a *member* (not just a part) of the system of rational beings.\" If you only see yourself as a \u0027part\u0027, you don\u0027t genuinely love people yet. Doing good isn\u0027t just a chore, it\u0027s benefiting *yourself* because you\u0027re part of the whole.\n14. **External Hits Don\u0027t Hurt *You* (Unless You Let Them):** Let outside events hit whatever they can hit. Those affected parts can complain if they want. But *you*, your core self, aren\u0027t harmed unless you *judge* the event as evil. And that judgment is *your* call.\n15. **Be Unshakeably Good:** No matter what anyone does or says, your job is to be good. Like gold stays gold, emeralds stay emerald green. Stick to your true nature.\n16. **Your Mind Controls Its Own Chaos:** Your core self doesn\u0027t *need* to freak itself out or chase desires. If someone *else* causes pain or fear, let them. Your mind doesn\u0027t have to buy into it or react emotionally unless it *chooses* to judge it that way. Let the body feel what it feels, let the emotions flare if they must, but the core judgment center remains untouched unless it gives consent. It has no needs unless it creates them. It\u0027s undisturbed unless it disturbs itself.\n17. **Happiness is Inner Strength:** Happiness is good character, a solid inner guide. See those nagging, negative thoughts (\u0027phantoms\u0027)? Tell them: \"Get lost! I don\u0027t need you. You\u0027re just old habits. I\u0027m not mad, just... leave.\"\n18. **Fear Change? Seriously?:** Scared of change? How does *anything* happen without it? Can you bathe without wood changing to heat? Eat without food changing? Can *any* useful thing happen without change? Your own change is just like nature\u0027s – essential and normal.\n19. **Everyone Passes Through:** Bodies flow through the universe like stuff in a flood. We\u0027re part of the system, working together like body parts. How many smart guys (Chrysippus, Socrates, Epictetus) has time already swallowed? Same goes for everyone and everything.\n20. **My Only Worry:** The only thing that really bothers me is the possibility of *me* doing something against human nature, or the wrong way, or something that\u0027s just not right *now*.\n21. **You\u0027ll Forget, You\u0027ll Be Forgotten:** Soon, you\u0027ll forget everything. Soon, everyone will forget you.\n22. **Love People Even When They Screw Up:** It\u0027s human to love even those who mess up. Remember: they\u0027re your kin, they act out of ignorance (not pure malice), you\u0027ll both be dead soon anyway, and most importantly – they haven\u0027t actually harmed your *core self* (your ability to judge and act right).\n23. **Nature Recycles Everything:** The Universe shapes matter like wax – now a horse, melts it down, now a tree, then a person, then something else. Each lasts a short time. No big deal for a box to be broken apart; it was no big deal for it to be put together. Same goes for us.\n24. **A Scowl is Unnatural:** A pissed-off look goes against Nature. Keep doing it, and your expression freezes or dies. It loses its light. That\u0027s anti-Reason. If you lose the *awareness* that you\u0027re doing wrong, what\u0027s the point of living?\n25. **Nature: Constant Refresh:** Everything you see will be changed instantly by the governing Nature. It\u0027ll make new stuff from the old material, then new stuff from that. The world stays young through constant recycling.\n26. **Understand Their Bad Motives, Then Forgive:** Someone screws you over? Instantly figure out *their* twisted idea of \u0027good\u0027 or \u0027bad\u0027 that made them do it. Once you see their flawed thinking, you\u0027ll pity them, not be shocked or angry. Maybe you still hold similar flawed ideas yourself sometimes? Then you *have* to cut them slack. If you\u0027ve moved past those errors, it\u0027s even easier to be kind to someone still stuck in the dark.\n27. **Value What You Have, Don\u0027t Obsess Over What You Don\u0027t:** Stop daydreaming about stuff you don\u0027t have as if it\u0027s already yours. Instead, appreciate the good things you *do* have. Think how much you\u0027d miss them if they were gone. BUT, don\u0027t get so attached that you\u0027ll freak out if they disappear later. Enjoy, don\u0027t cling.\n28. **Retreat Inside:** Go inward. Your rational mind is naturally content when it acts justly and finds the peace that brings.\n29. **Mental Hygiene Checklist:** Wipe away distracting thoughts. Stop impulsive reactions. Define the present moment. See clearly what\u0027s happening (to you or others). Break events down: cause \u0026 material. Think about your own death. Leave others\u0027 wrongdoings with them – not your problem to carry.\n30. **Focus Inward and Outward:** Pay attention to what\u0027s being said. Understand what\u0027s happening and who\u0027s doing it.\n31. **Keep it Simple, Love People, Follow Nature:** Find joy in simplicity, self-respect, and not giving a damn about things between virtue and vice. Love humanity. Follow the natural order (God). Remember the basics: reality follows laws. Focus on that.\n32. **Death? Scatter or Relocate:** What happens at death? Either atoms disperse, or if we\u0027re a unified consciousness, we\u0027re extinguished or move elsewhere. Either way, it\u0027s a natural process.\n33. **Pain? Bearable or Terminal:** Unbearable pain kills you quickly. Pain that lasts *can* be borne. Your mind can stay calm by detaching. The core self isn\u0027t damaged. Let the injured body parts complain if they must.\n34. **Fame? Shifting Sands:** Look at the minds of those whose approval you seek – what they chase, what they avoid. Besides, fame is like sand dunes constantly shifting, burying what came before. Life\u0027s the same – the past gets quickly buried by the present.\n35. **Big Picture View Shrinks Life\u0027s Dramas:** (Paraphrasing Plato) \"Does a mind with real perspective, seeing all time and reality, think this little human life is a huge deal?\" \"No way.\" \"So, such a person won\u0027t see death as terrifying either, right?\" \"Definitely not.\"\n36. **Leader\u0027s Job: Do Good, Get Criticized.** That\u0027s the gig.\n37. **Mind Shapes the Face, Mind Shapes Itself:** Isn\u0027t it weird that your face can reflect your mind\u0027s commands (look serious, look happy), but the mind itself often fails to shape *itself* beautifully according to its own reason?\n38. **Don\u0027t Rage at Things:** \"Yelling at inanimate objects is pointless; they don\u0027t care.\" (Euripides quote relevant to not getting mad at external events).\n39. **Bring Joy to Gods and Men:** (Another quote fragment likely meaning act virtuously).\n40. **Life\u0027s Cycle:** \"Life\u0027s like ripe grain, harvested in time. One exists, another vanishes.\" (Accept the natural cycle).\n41. **Even if Neglected, Reason Remains:** \"If the gods ignored me and my kids, there\u0027s still a rational basis for things.\" (Trusting underlying order even if feeling abandoned).\n42. **Goodness is On My Side:** \"Righteousness and Goodness stand with me.\" (Confidence in virtue).\n43. **Don\u0027t Catch Others\u0027 Misery:** \"Don\u0027t grieve *with* them; don\u0027t get sucked into their emotional turmoil.\" (Empathy, not emotional contagion).\n44. **Socrates on Risk vs. Right:** (Paraphrasing Plato\u0027s Apology) \"My answer would be: You\u0027re wrong, buddy, if you think a decent person calculates risks of life/death. They only consider one thing: Am I doing right or wrong? Acting like a good person or a bad one?\"\n45. **Socrates on Duty Over Safety:** (More Apology) \"Look, Athenians, wherever a man takes his stand, thinking it\u0027s best, or where his commander puts him, he *must* stay and face the risk, ignoring death or anything else compared to dishonor.\"\n46. **Socrates on Quality Over Quantity of Life:** (More Plato) \"But maybe true courage and virtue aren\u0027t just about saving your skin. Maybe a real man sets aside living as long as possible, doesn\u0027t cling to life, trusts the bigger picture (God), accepts fate, and focuses *only* on living the *best possible* life in the time he has.\"\n47. **Cosmic Perspective Cleans the Soul:** Watch the stars like you\u0027re running with them. Think constantly about how elements change into each other. These big-picture thoughts wash away the muck of petty daily life.\n48. **Bird\u0027s-Eye View of Humanity:** When thinking about people, look down on earthly affairs as if from above: herds, armies, farms, marriages, divorces, births, deaths, courtroom chaos, empty places, different cultures, festivals, funerals, markets – the whole messy mix, an order made of opposites.\n49. **Past Predicts Future (It\u0027s All Human Nature):** Look at the past – endless changes in power. You can predict the future too – it\u0027ll be the same patterns. Human nature doesn\u0027t change *that* much. Studying 40 years of human life is like studying 10,000. What more are you going to see?\n50. **Back to Basics (Atomism/Spirit):** \"Earthly parts go back to earth; ethereal sparks return to the heavens.\" Or maybe it\u0027s just atoms unhooking and scattering.\n51. **Trying to Cheat Death/Fate:** (Quotes about trying to magically avoid death or fate). Pointless. \"You gotta endure the winds God sends, and work without whining.\"\n52. **Better Wrestler ≠ Better Person:** Someone might be stronger physically, but are they more social, modest, better handling situations, kinder about others\u0027 flaws? Don\u0027t confuse different kinds of \u0027better\u0027.\n53. **No Fear Where Reason Works:** If a task can be done following the shared reason of gods and men, there’s nothing to fear. Where you can benefit by acting rationally and according to your nature, there’s no real harm to worry about.\n54. **Your Power: Acceptance, Justice, Clarity NOW:** Everywhere, always, you have the power to: be genuinely okay with your current situation, treat people rightly, and analyze your present thoughts clearly so nothing half-baked gets in.\n55. **Follow Nature\u0027s Lead (Yours \u0026 Universal):** Don\u0027t get distracted by other people\u0027s internal worlds. Look straight ahead to where Nature leads you – Universal Nature via events, your own nature via your duties. Do what your constitution requires. Other creatures serve the rational; rational creatures serve each other. So: 1) Be social. 2) Master bodily passions (Reason rules senses/impulses). 3) Avoid rash judgments, don\u0027t be fooled. Stick to these, walk straight, and you own what\u0027s truly yours.\n56. **Live the Rest Like You\u0027re Already Dead:** Act as if you died and this moment is bonus time. Use what\u0027s left to live according to Nature, properly.\n57. **Love Your Own Path:** Love only what life actually assigns you, your own destiny. What could be more fitting?\n58. **Learn from Others\u0027 Mistakes:** When something happens, remember others who faced the same thing – they got upset, surprised, complained. Where are they now? Nowhere. Do you want to follow their path? Ditch those reactions. Focus *only* on how *you* can use the situation well. The event is just raw material. Be fair to yourself in your response. Remember: what you do matters, but the *external sphere* where you do it is less important.\n59. **Dig Within for the Good Stuff:** Dig inside yourself. The source of good is there, always ready to flow if you just keep digging.\n60. **Body Composed Too:** Your body should also be composed, not sloppy, whether moving or still. Your physical presence should reflect the calm intelligence of your mind. But don\u0027t be fake about it.\n61. **Life is Wrestling, Not Dancing:** Living well is more like wrestling than dancing. You need to be ready, steady, prepared for unexpected takedowns, not just following choreographed steps.\n62. **Consider the Source (of Approval):** Always look closely at the kind of people whose approval you want. Understand *their* core principles and motivations. If you see where their judgments come from, you won\u0027t blame them when they screw up, nor will you desperately need their validation.\n63. **Truth Matters (To Everyone, Deep Down):** \"No soul *wants* to be deprived of truth.\" Same for justice, temperance, kindness. Keep this in mind always; it\u0027ll make you gentler with everyone.\n64. **Pain Isn\u0027t Evil; Use Epicurus:** For any pain, remind yourself: it\u0027s not morally evil, it doesn\u0027t damage your core mind (Reason/social nature). For most pains, Epicurus helps: \"Pain is either short or bearable. Know its limits, don\u0027t add imaginary suffering.\" Remember many discomforts (drowsiness, heat, no appetite) are types of pain. When disgusted, tell yourself: \"You\u0027re giving in to pain.\"\n65. **Don\u0027t Become Inhuman Towards the Inhuman:** See that you don\u0027t adopt the same cruel or callous attitudes towards awful people that they show towards humanity. Stay human.\n66. **Judge Character Deeply (Socrates Example):** How do we know if some obscure guy (Telauges) wasn\u0027t better than famous Socrates? It\u0027s not just about Socrates\u0027 dramatic death, debating skill, endurance, moral stands, or swagger. We need to ask: What was his *soul* like? Was he content being just and fair? Did he handle wickedness without instant rage? Did he tolerate others\u0027 ignorance? Did he accept fate without drama? Did he keep his mind free from being ruled by bodily feelings? That\u0027s the real measure.\n67. **Freedom is Possible, Even Without Being Einstein:** Nature didn\u0027t fuse you so tightly to the world that you can\u0027t define your own space and control what\u0027s yours. Remember this. A good life needs very few things. Just because you\u0027re not a genius scholar doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t be free, modest, helpful, and aligned with Nature/God. You can be truly godlike without anyone noticing.\n68. **Live Fully, Unrestrained, Despite Chaos:** Live your life freely and gladly, even if everyone yells at you, even if wild animals tear apart this meat-sack body you inhabit. What stops your mind from staying calm, judging reality accurately, and readily using whatever comes its way? Judgment says to events: \"This is what you *really* are, despite appearances.\" Use says to resources: \"Ah, there you are. I was looking for you. The present is always raw material for virtue, for the art of being human/divine.\" Whatever happens fits the plan, it\u0027s not new or impossible, just familiar stuff to handle.\n69. **Mark of Good Character:** Live each day like it\u0027s your last. No frantic energy, no apathy, no pretending.\n70. **Gods Tolerate Idiots, So Can You:** The immortal gods aren\u0027t pissed off that they have to eternally put up with countless worthless humans; they even help them. You, who are almost gone anyway, are giving up the struggle? Even though you\u0027re one of the flawed ones yourself?\n71. **Run From Your Own Flaws, Not Others\u0027:** It\u0027s ridiculous *not* to escape your own bad habits (which *is* possible), but try to escape other people\u0027s bad habits (which is *impossible*).\n72. **Reason Filters Out Crap:** Whatever your rational, social mind finds to be *not* intelligent or social, it rightly judges as beneath it.\n73. **Do Good for Its Own Sake:** You did something good for someone else. Why do you need a third thing, like idiots do – like needing applause or expecting payback?\n74. **Giving is Receiving:** Nobody gets tired of receiving benefits. Benefiting others *is* acting according to Nature. So don\u0027t get tired of the \u0027benefit\u0027 *you* receive by *doing* good.",

      "text": "Okay, let\u0027s run Book VII through the \"Bro\" translator. Maintaining the core Marcus Aurelius, but with that direct, no-frills vibe.\n\n**MEDITATIONS BOOK VII - THE BRO VERSION**\n\n1.  **Same Problems, Different Day:** This crap bothering you? Yeah, you\u0027ve seen it before. Get this thought ready for *any* problem: \"I recognize this pattern.\" Look around – history books, news feeds, your own life – it\u0027s the same human dramas playing out, up and down. Nothing\u0027s truly new. It’s all familiar, and it all passes.\n2.  **Your Principles Aren\u0027t Dead Unless You Let Them Be:** Your core beliefs only die if the thinking behind them fades out. It\u0027s YOUR job to keep relighting that fire. Think: \"Can I handle this situation rationally? Yes? Then why am I stressed? Stuff outside my direct control can\u0027t actually mess with my *mind*.\" Get that, and you\u0027re solid. You can always bounce back mentally. Just look at things clearly again, like you did before. That *is* coming back to life.\n3.  **Life\u0027s a Weird Show, Know Your Worth:** Fancy ceremonies, drama on TV, herds of sheep, people posturing in meetings, throwing scraps to pets, ants busy as hell, mice freaking out, puppets on strings... Life\u0027s full of this stuff. Your job? Stand tall in the middle of it. Be kind, don\u0027t get arrogant. And understand this: Your real worth is based on what you genuinely value and pursue.\n4.  **Focus: Listen, Observe, Understand:** When talking, *really listen* to what\u0027s being said. When acting, *really see* what\u0027s happening and why. Dig for the underlying meaning and the root cause.\n5.  **Use Your Brain or Get Help:** Is your head sharp enough for this job? If yes, use it – it’s the tool Nature gave you. If not, either step back and let someone better handle it (if that’s the right move overall), OR do the best you can *with backup*. Team up with someone whose skills complement yours to get the job done for the common good. Bottom line: whatever you do, alone or with others, it should aim to help the whole team, the bigger picture.\n6.  **Fame? Gone Faster Than You Think:** How many people who were once famous are totally forgotten now? And how many people who sang their praises are long dead too? So much for leaving a legacy through fame.\n7.  **No Shame in Getting a Hand:** Don\u0027t be embarrassed to need help. Your job is to get your mission done, like a soldier scaling a wall. If you\u0027re injured and can\u0027t do it alone, you get help. Mission first.\n8.  **Future You Has Got This:** Stop stressing about the future. If and when you get there, you\u0027ll face it with the exact same reasoning skills you\u0027re using right now to handle today. You’re already equipped.\n9.  **It\u0027s All Connected, Man:** Everything\u0027s woven together in one sacred web. Hardly anything is truly separate. It\u0027s all arranged together, forming one orderly universe. One reality, one underlying principle (God/Nature), one basic substance, one law, one shared Reason for all thinking beings, one truth. We\u0027re all part of the same system, playing on the same team.\n10. **Stuff Vanishes, Causes Merge, Memory Fades:** Physical things disappear back into the cosmic soup super fast. The \u0027why\u0027 behind things gets absorbed into the big picture real quick. And the memory of anything? Buried by time even faster.\n11. **Rational \u003d Natural (For Us):** For a thinking creature like you, acting reasonably *is* acting according to your nature. They\u0027re the same thing.\n12. **Stand Tall:** Either stand upright by your own strength, or be *kept* upright by your principles.\n13. **Member, Not Just Part:** Thinking beings are made for cooperation, like limbs on a body. Really grasp this by thinking: \"I am a *member* of the system of rational beings.\" If you just call yourself a \u0027part\u0027 (like a disconnected piece), you don\u0027t truly love people yet. Doing good isn\u0027t just a chore you *have* to do; it\u0027s something that benefits *you* because you\u0027re benefiting the whole you belong to.\n14. **Externals Can\u0027t Hurt Your Core:** Let outside events hit whatever physical or emotional parts they can hit. Those parts can complain if they want. But *you* – your core self, your judgment center – aren\u0027t harmed unless you *decide* to view the event as evil. And that decision? It\u0027s entirely up to you.\n15. **Be Unshakeably You (Good):** No matter what anyone else does or says, your job is to be fundamentally good. Just like gold stays gold, emeralds stay green. Stick to your core nature, maintain your integrity.\n16. **Your Mind is Its Own Boss (Unless It Abdicates):** Your core self doesn\u0027t need to freak itself out or chase stupid desires. If someone *else* can cause you pain or fear, let them try. Your mind won\u0027t automatically fold and adopt those feelings unless it *agrees* with the judgment that something bad is happening. Let the body take care of itself, let feelings signal things, but the central command – your judgment – doesn\u0027t suffer unless it *chooses* to interpret things badly. It has no needs unless it creates them; it\u0027s untroubled unless it troubles itself.\n17. **Happiness \u003d Good Inner State:** Real happiness is having a strong inner character, a good internal guide. See those nagging negative thoughts, those \u0027imagination phantoms\u0027? Tell them: \"Beat it! Seriously, get lost. I don\u0027t need you. You\u0027re just an old bad habit. I\u0027m not pissed, just... leave.\"\n18. **Seriously, You Fear Change?:** Scared of change? How does *anything* useful happen without it? Can you take a hot shower without wood changing into heat? Can you eat without food changing? Can *any* progress occur without change? Your own personal changes are exactly the same – natural, necessary, and part of how the universe works.\n19. **Everyone Flows Through:** All bodies pass through the universe like debris in a flood. We\u0027re connected to the whole, cooperating with it, like our own limbs work together. Think how many brilliant minds (Chrysippus, Socrates, Epictetus) time has already swept away. Apply that same thought to *every* person, *every* thing. Nothing lasts forever in its current form.\n20. **My Only Real Concern:** The single thing that truly worries me is the possibility of *me* doing something that goes against rational human nature, or doing it the wrong way, or doing something that just isn\u0027t right for *this* moment. My own screw-ups are the only real threat.\n21. **Forgetting and Being Forgotten:** You\u0027re close to forgetting everything. And everything is close to forgetting you.\n22. **Love People, Even Screw-Ups:** It\u0027s fundamentally human to love even those who mess up. This clicks when you realize: they\u0027re family (humanity), they screw up out of ignorance or weakness (not pure evil, usually against their better judgment), you\u0027ll *both* be dead soon enough, and crucially – they didn\u0027t actually harm your *inner self*, your core ability to judge and act right.\n23. **Nature Recycles Endlessly:** The Universe uses matter like wax – makes a horse, melts it, makes a tree, melts it, makes a person, melts it... Each form lasts only a little while. It\u0027s no hardship for a wooden box to be taken apart; it wasn\u0027t a big deal when it was nailed together. Same principle applies to us. It\u0027s just change.\n24. **A Scowl is Anti-Reason:** A constantly angry or frowning face is deeply unnatural. Keep it up, and the expression either freezes that way or dies out, losing its capacity for warmth. Try to get this: it\u0027s against Reason. If you even lose the *awareness* that you\u0027re acting wrongly, what reason is left for living?\n25. **Constant Refresh Button:** Nature, running the whole show, will change everything you see almost instantly. It\u0027ll make new things from the old materials, and then newer things from those. That\u0027s how the world stays fresh and young.\n26. **See Their Bad Logic, Find Pity:** Someone wrongs you? Immediately figure out *their* flawed idea of \u0027good\u0027 or \u0027bad\u0027 that drove them. Once you see their messed-up perspective, you\u0027ll feel pity, not shock or anger. Maybe you still hold some similar bad ideas yourself? Then you *have* to forgive them. If you\u0027ve moved past those specific errors, you\u0027ll find it even easier to be kind to someone whose thinking is still clouded.\n27. **Value What You Have Now, Don\u0027t Cling:** Stop obsessing over things you *don\u0027t* have as if they\u0027re already here. Instead, focus on the good stuff you *do* have. Appreciate it. Remind yourself how much you\u0027d miss it if it were gone. *But*—and this is key—don\u0027t get so attached that you\u0027ll be devastated if it disappears later. Value it, use it, be grateful, but hold it lightly.\n28. **Go Inward for Peace:** Retreat into yourself. Your rational core self is naturally content when it acts justly and achieves the calm that comes with it.\n29. **Mental Checklist for Clarity:** 1) Wipe away distracting mental images. 2) Stop acting on raw impulse. 3) Define the present moment clearly. 4) Recognize what\u0027s *really* happening (to you or others). 5) Break down the event: What caused it? What\u0027s it made of? 6) Think about your own final hour. 7) Leave the other person\u0027s wrongdoing where it started – with them.\n30. **Track the Action:** Focus your thought on what\u0027s being said. Let your mind penetrate what\u0027s actually happening and who\u0027s driving the action.\n31. **Simple Gladness, Love People, Follow Nature:** Make yourself happy with simplicity, self-respect, and being indifferent to the stuff that falls between actual virtue and vice. Love humanity. Follow the natural order (God/Reason). Remember the core truth: reality follows rules. That\u0027s enough.\n32. **Death? Scatter, Snuff Out, or Move On:** What happens when you die? Either your atoms scatter, or if you\u0027re a unified thing, you\u0027re extinguished, or you change your address. It\u0027s a transition.\n33. **Pain? Can Bear or Can\u0027t:** Pain you literally can\u0027t bear removes you from life (you die). Pain that lasts *can* be borne. Your mind can keep its cool by detaching. Your core self doesn\u0027t get worse. Let the injured body parts signal pain if they need to.\n34. **Fame? Look at Their Minds \u0026 Shifting Sands:** Want fame? Look at the minds of the people you want it from – what they chase, what they run from. Besides, fame is like watching sand dunes shift – the old layers get quickly buried by the new. In life, the past is just as quickly buried by what comes next.\n35. **Big Picture vs. Mortal Life (Plato):** \u0027Think a mind with real scope, viewing all time and reality, considers this brief mortal life a *huge* deal?\u0027 \u0027Impossible.\u0027 \u0027So that kind of person won\u0027t see death as terrifying either, right?\u0027 \u0027Absolutely.\u0027\n36. **Leader\u0027s Job Description:** Do good work, get criticized for it. That\u0027s the deal.\n37. **Mind Should Shape Itself:** Isn\u0027t it absurd that your face obeys your mind\u0027s commands (look serious, smile), but your mind itself often fails to shape *itself* according to its own rational standards of beauty and order?\n38. **Don\u0027t Waste Anger on Things:** \u0027Yelling at rocks won\u0027t help; they don\u0027t care.\u0027 (Don\u0027t get mad at external events or inanimate objects).\n39. **Bring Joy (Act Well):** \u0027May you bring joy to the gods and to humans.\u0027 (Live virtuously).\n40. **Life\u0027s Harvest:** \u0027Life, like ripe grain, yields to the harvest. One must exist, another must cease.\u0027 (Accept mortality\u0027s cycle).\n41. **Reason Remains:** \u0027Even if the gods ignored me and mine, there\u0027s still reason in the universe.\u0027 (Trust the underlying order).\n42. **Goodness is My Ally:** \u0027Righteousness and Goodness are on my side.\u0027 (Confidence in virtue).\n43. **Don\u0027t Absorb Misery:** \u0027Don\u0027t mourn *with* them; don\u0027t get sucked into their emotional chaos.\u0027 (Show support, don\u0027t catch the disease).\n44. **Socrates: Right vs. Wrong is the Only Question:** \u0027My answer: You\u0027re mistaken, friend, if you think anyone worthwhile should calculate risks of life or death. The only question when acting is: Am I doing right or wrong? Acting like a good person or a bad one?\u0027\n45. **Socrates: Duty Before Safety:** \u0027Honestly, Athenians, it\u0027s like this: Wherever you take your post, believing it\u0027s best, or where your leader places you, you *must* stay and face the danger, considering nothing—death or anything else—compared to acting dishonorably.\u0027\n46. **Socrates: Best Life, Not Longest Life:** \u0027But maybe real courage isn\u0027t just about saving your skin. Maybe a true man puts aside trying to live as long as possible, doesn\u0027t cling to life, trusts the bigger picture (God/Fate), and focuses *only* on living the *best possible* life in the time he\u0027s got.\u0027\n47. **Cosmic View Cleans Your Head:** Watch the stars move like you\u0027re running alongside them. Constantly think about how elements change into one another. These big-picture thoughts wash away the dirt and grime of petty daily worries.\n48. **Look Down on Earthly Chaos:** When thinking about humanity, imagine looking down from space: herds, armies, farms, weddings, divorces, births, deaths, noisy courts, empty deserts, different cultures, parties, funerals, markets – the whole chaotic mix, an order made of opposites. See the patterns.\n49. **History Repeats (Human Nature is Stable):** Look at the past – endless rise and fall of powers. You can predict the future too; it\u0027ll follow similar patterns because human nature doesn\u0027t fundamentally change that fast. Studying 40 years of human life tells you as much as studying 10,000. What more are you really going to see?\n50. **Back to Earth, Spirit to Sky (Or Atoms Scatter):** \u0027Earthly parts return to earth; the divine spark returns to the heavens.\u0027 Or maybe it\u0027s just the atoms unlinking and scattering.\n51. **Trying to Dodge Fate:** (Quotes about using magic or tricks to avoid death/fate). Pointless. \u0027You gotta face the winds God sends, and keep working without whining.\u0027\n52. **Different Kinds of \u0027Better\u0027:** Someone might be a \u0027better wrestler\u0027 (stronger, more skilled physically), but does that make them more cooperative, more modest, better prepared for life\u0027s twists, or kinder to neighbors\u0027 faults? Don\u0027t confuse physical prowess with character.\n53. **No Fear Where Reason Guides:** If a task can be done following the shared principles of reason (common to humans and the universe/gods), there\u0027s nothing to fear. Where you can get benefit by acting rationally and according to your nature, there\u0027s no real harm to suspect.\n54. **Your Constant Power:** Everywhere, always, you *can* choose to: 1) Be genuinely okay with your current situation (acceptance). 2) Treat people around you fairly (justice). 3) Analyze your current thoughts skillfully, so no unexamined crap gets through (clarity).\n55. **Follow Your Nature (Rational \u0026 Social):** Don\u0027t get lost looking at other people\u0027s internal states. Look straight ahead to where Nature leads you – Universal Nature through external events, and your *own* nature through your duties. Each thing must do what it\u0027s built for. Other creatures exist for the sake of rational ones; rational ones exist for each other. So your primary job is: 1) Be social, contribute. 2) Master your body\u0027s urges (Reason rules senses). 3) Avoid snap judgments, don\u0027t be fooled. Stick to these, walk a straight path, and you possess what is truly yours – your character.\n56. **Live the Rest Like Bonus Time:** Act as if you already died, and this moment forward is extra innings. Use the remaining time to live properly, according to Nature.\n57. **Love What\u0027s Yours:** Love only your actual path, your own destiny, what life assigns you. What could possibly suit you better?\n58. **See the Pattern, Choose Differently:** When something bad happens, immediately think of others who faced the same thing. Remember how they freaked out, were shocked, complained. Where are they now? Gone. Do you want to end up reacting like them? Ditch those emotional reactions. Focus *entirely* on how *you* can use this situation constructively. The event is just raw material. Pay attention, resolve to be fair to yourself in your response. Remember both: what you do *internally* matters immensely; the *external* situation itself is ultimately neutral.\n59. **Dig Within:** Keep digging inside yourself. The source of good is in there, always ready to bubble up if you just keep digging for it.\n60. **Composed Body, Too:** Your body should also be held with composure, not sloppy or agitated, whether moving or still. Just as your mind aims for intelligence and grace, your body should reflect that. But don\u0027t be artificial or stiff about it.\n61. **Life \u003d Wrestling, Not Dancing:** The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing. You need to be prepared, balanced, and ready to handle unexpected challenges, not just smoothly executing planned moves.\n62. **Whose Applause Do You Want?:** Constantly consider *who* these people are whose approval you seek. Look at *their* core principles. If you understand the source of their judgments and impulses, you won\u0027t blame them when they inevitably stumble, nor will you desperately need their validation.\n63. **Nobody *Wants* to Be Wrong:** Remember this: \u0027No soul is willingly deprived of truth.\u0027 The same goes for justice, self-control, kindness. Keep this firmly in mind; it\u0027ll make you gentler towards everyone.\n64. **Pain: Not Evil, Limits Apply:** Facing any pain, have this ready: \"This isn\u0027t morally evil. It doesn\u0027t injure my core intelligence.\" It can\u0027t destroy your rational/social self. For most pains, Epicurus\u0027s advice helps: \u0027Pain is either unbearable (and thus short) or long (and thus bearable). Remember its limits, and don\u0027t add extra suffering with your imagination.\u0027 Also, recognize that many unpleasant things (drowsiness, intense heat, loss of appetite) are just forms of pain. When you feel gross, tell yourself: \u0027You are giving in to pain.\u0027\n65. **Don\u0027t Mirror Inhumanity:** Make sure you don\u0027t start feeling towards inhuman people the same way *they* feel towards humanity. Don\u0027t let their cruelty corrupt you.\n66. **True Character vs. Surface Fame (Socrates):** How do we *really* know if some unknown guy (Telauges) wasn\u0027t better than famous Socrates? It\u0027s not enough that Socrates had a famous death, argued well, endured cold, made brave stands, or walked proudly. We have to ask: What was his *soul* like? Was he content just being fair to people and respectful to the gods/reality? Did he handle wickedness without flying off the handle? Was he patient with ignorance? Did he accept his fate without seeing it as alien or unbearable? Did he keep his mind from being bossed around by his body\u0027s feelings? *That\u0027s* the real test.\n67. **Godlike is Possible for Anyone:** Nature didn\u0027t lock you into the world so tightly that you can\u0027t carve out your own space and control what\u0027s yours. Always remember: a truly blessed life depends on very few things. Just because you aren\u0027t a genius philosopher or scientist doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t be free, modest, helpful to others, and aligned with reality (God). It\u0027s possible to become truly godlike in character even if nobody ever recognizes it.\n68. **Live Free and Glad, No Matter What:** Live your life unrestrained, fully glad, even if everyone screams insults, even if wild beasts tear apart this physical shell you wear. What\u0027s stopping your mind from staying calm, judging surroundings accurately, and readily using whatever comes its way? Your judgment tells events: \"This is what you are in reality, even if you look different.\" Your ability to act tells resources: \"Ah, I was looking for you. The present moment is *always* raw material for virtue, for the art of being human or godlike.\" Whatever happens fits the universal plan; it\u0027s not new or impossible, just familiar stuff to handle well.\n69. **Mark of Excellence:** Live each day as if it were your last. Avoid both frantic agitation and lazy apathy. Don\u0027t just play a role; be authentic.\n70. **Gods Tolerate Fools, So Can You (Briefly):** The immortal gods aren\u0027t perpetually annoyed that they have to put up with so many flawed humans forever; they even help them out. You, who are about to vanish any second, are giving up the effort? Even though you\u0027re one of the flawed ones yourself? Come on.\n71. **Flee Your Own Bad Habits, Not Others\u0027:** It\u0027s ridiculous *not* to escape your own vices (which *is* possible), while trying to flee other people\u0027s vices (which is *impossible*). Focus on your own improvement.\n72. **Reason Filters:** Whatever your rational and social faculty finds to be *not* intelligent or social, it rightly judges as beneath its concern.\n73. **Do Good, Move On:** You did a good deed for someone. Why do you need a third thing, like a fool – needing to be *seen* doing good, or expecting a reward? The action itself is the point.\n74. **Giving Benefits You Too:** Nobody gets tired of receiving help. And helping others *is* acting according to Nature. So don\u0027t get tired of the \u0027benefit\u0027 *you* receive by *doing* good deeds. It reinforces your own virtuous nature.",

      "text": "BOOK VIII\n\n1. This also conduces to contempt of vain-glory, that it is no longer in your power to have lived your whole life, or at any rate your life from manhood, in the pursuit of philosophy. To yourself as well as to many others it is plain that you fall far short of philosophy. And so you are tainted, and it is no longer easy for you to acquire the reputation of a philosopher. Your calling, too, in life has a rival claim. Therefore, if you have truly seen where the matter at issue lies, put away the question of what men will think of you and be satisfied if you live the rest of your life, be it more or less, as your nature wills. Consider accordingly what it does will, and let nothing besides distract you; for experience has taught you in how many paths you have strayed and nowhere found the good life: not in logical arguments, not in riches, not in glory, not in self-indulgence, nowhere. Where then is it to be found? In doing what man\u0027s nature requires. How then will he do this? If he hold fast doctrines upon which impulses and actions depend. What doctrines are these? They concern good and evil, how nothing is good for man which does not make him just, sober, brave and free; nothing evil which does not produce effects the opposite of these.\n\n2. On the occasion of each act, ask yourself: \u0027How is this related to me? Shall I repent of it? But a little while and I am dead and all things are taken away. What more do I require, if my present work is the work of an intelligent and social creature, subject to the same law as God?\u0027\n\n3. Alexander, Julius Caesar, and Pompeius, what are they by comparison with Diogenes, Heraclitus, and Socrates? For these men saw reality and its causal and material aspects, and their ruling selves were self-determined; but as for the former, how much there was to provide for, and of how many things they were the servants,\n\n4. Even if you break your heart, none the less they will do just the same.\n\n5. In the first place, be not troubled; for all things are according to Universal Nature, and in a little while you will be no one and nowhere, even as Hadrian and Augustus are no more. Next, looking earnestly at the question, perceive its essence, and reminding yourself that your duty is to be a good man, and what it is that man\u0027s nature demands, do that without swerving, and speak the thing that appears to you to be most just, provided only that it is with kindness and modesty, and without hypocrisy.\n\n6. The work of Universal Nature is this: to transfer what is here to there, to make changes, to take up from here and to carry there. All things are alterations, but the assignments, too, are impartial: all things are familiar, but not so that we need dread some new experience.\n\n7. Every natural thing is satisfied when it fares well, and a reasonable nature fares well when it gives its assent to nothing false or obscure in its imaginations, directs its impulses only to social ends, desires and avoids only what is in our power, and welcomes all that is assigned by Universal Nature. For it is a part of Universal Nature, just as the leaf\u0027s nature is part of the plant\u0027s, only in that case the leaf\u0027s nature is part of a Nature naturally without sense or reason and able to be hindered, whereas man\u0027s nature is part of a Nature which is unhindered and reasonable and just, inasmuch as it assigns to each, impartially and according to its worth, its share of times, substance, cause, activity, experience. Consider, however, not whether you will find one thing equal to another in everything, but whether the whole of this taken together is not equal to the whole of that other.\n\n8. You are not able to read; but you are able to restrain your arrogance, you are able to rise above pleasures and pains, you are able to be superior to fame, you are able not only not to be angry with the unfeeling and graceless, but to care for them besides.\n\n9. Let no one any longer hear you finding fault with your life in a palace; nay, do not even hear yourself.\n\n10. Regret is blame of oneself for having let something useful go by; but the good must be something useful and worth the attention of a really good man. Now no really good man would regret having let a pleasure go by: no pleasure, therefore, is either useful or good.\n\n11. What is this by itself in its own constitution, what is its substance or substrate, what its causal element, what its function in the world and how long a time does it persist?\n\n12. When you are called from sleep with difficulty, revive the thought that to render social acts is according to your constitution and to human nature, but to sleep is what you share also with dumb animals. Now what to every creature is according to Nature is also more closely related to it, more part of its flesh and bone, yes, and also more agreeable.\n\n13. Continually and, if possible, on the occasion of every imagination, test it by natural science, by psychology, by logic.\n\n14. Whatever man you meet, say to yourself at once: \u0027what are the principles this man entertains about human goods and ills?\u0027 For if he has certain principles about pleasure and pain and the sources of these, about honour and dishonour, about death and life, it will not seem surprising or strange to me if he acts in certain ways, and I shall remember that he is obliged to act like this.\n\n15. Remember that it is as absurd to be surprised that the world brings forth the fruits with which it teems as that the fig-tree should bear figs. And it is absurd for the physician or the master of a ship to be surprised, if a patient is feverish or if a head-wind gets up.\n\n16. Remember that to change your course and to follow some one who puts you right is not to be less free. For the change is your own action, proceeding according to your own impulse and decision, and indeed according to your mind.\n\n17. If it is in your power to decide, why do you do it? But if in another\u0027s, whom do you find fault with? The atoms or the gods? Either is madness. You must find fault with no one. If you are able, put him right; if you can\u0027t do this, at least put the thing itself right; but if you can\u0027t even do this, to what purpose still does fault-finding tend? For nothing should be done without a purpose.\n\n18. What dies does not fall outside the Universe. If it remains here and changes here, it is also resolved here into the eternal constituents, which are elements of the Universe and of yourself. And the elements themselves change and make no grievance of it.\n\n19. Each has come into being for a purpose—a horse, say, or a vine. Why are you surprised? So the Sun God will say: \u0027I came into being for a purpose\u0027, and the rest of the gods too. What then is the purpose of your coming to be? \u0027To please yourself?\u0027 See whether the idea allows itself to be framed.\n\n20. Nature has designed the ending of each thing, no less than its beginning and its continuance, like one who throws a ball up. What good is it to the ball to go up or harm to come down and even fall to the ground? What good to the bubble to be blown or harm to it to burst? The same is true of a candle.\n\n21. Turn it inside out and see the sort of thing it is, what it is like when it grows old or falls sick or . . . . . ..[1] Short-lived alike are praiser and the praised, he who remembers and he who is remembered. Moreover, they live in a mere corner of this region of the globe and even here all are not in accord, nor is even a man in accord with himself. The whole earth, too, is a mere point.\n\n22. Attend to the subject, the activity, the doctrine, or the meaning.\n\nYou deserve to suffer this; so you would rather become good to-morrow than be good to-day.\n\n23. Am I doing something? I relate the act to beneficence to men. Does an accident befall me? I accept it, relating it to the gods and to the source of all things, from which all that comes to pass depends by a common thread.\n\n24. As your bath appears to your senses—soap, sweat, dirt, greasy water, all disgusting—so is every piece of life and every object.\n\n25. Lucilla[2] laid Verus in the grave, Lucilla followed; Secunda buried Maximus, Secunda next; Epitynchanus buried Diotimus, Epitynchanus next; Antoninus Faustina, Antoninus next. The same story over again. Celer Hadrian, Celer came next. Where now are those acute minds, those who unveiled the future, those who were swollen with pride? acute minds like Charax and Demetrius and Eudaemon and others of their kind. All creatures of a day, dead long since; some remembered not even for a little while, some turned to fable, and some even now fading out of fable. Keep these facts in mind, that your own frame is bound either to be scattered into atoms or your spirit to be extinguished or to change its place and be stationed somewhere else.\n\n26. A man\u0027s joy is to do what is proper to man, and man\u0027s proper work is kindness to his fellow man, disdain of the movements of the senses, to discern plausible imaginations, to meditate on Universal Nature and the work of her hands.\n\n27. There are three relations: one to your environment, one to the divine cause from which all things come to pass for all, one to those who live at the same time with you.\n\n28. Pain is an evil, either to the body, in which case let the body say that it is so, or to the soul. But it is in the soul\u0027s power to preserve its own quiet and calm, and not to judge pain to be an evil; for every judgement, impulse, desire, or aversion is within, and nothing evil makes its way up to this.\n\n29. Wipe out impressions by continually saying to yourself: it is in my power now not to allow any wickedness to be in this soul of mine, any appetite or disturbance at all, but seeing what is the character of them all I employ each according to its worth. Remember this power as Nature requires.\n\n30. Speak both in the senate and to every man of whatever rank with propriety, without affectation. Use words that ring true.\n\n31. The court of Augustus, his wife, daughter, grandsons, stepsons, sister, Agrippa, his kinsmen, familiar friends, Areios, Maecenas, doctors, sacrificial ministers—a whole court dead. Next pass on to other courts—death not of a single individual, but of a family, like the children of Pompeius. Then the familiar inscription upon tombs: the last of his line. Calculate all the anxiety of those who preceded them in order to leave behind an heir, and then it was ordained that one should be the last; here again a whole family dead.\n\n32. You must plan your life, one action at a time, and be content if each acquires its own end as best it can; and that it should acquire its end, no one at all can prevent you. \u0027But some external obstacle will be in the way.\u0027 None to prevent action with justice, temperance, and due reflection. \u0027But possibly some other activity will be hindered.\u0027 Still, by meeting the actual obstacle with resignation and good-temperedly altering your course to what is granted you, a new action is at once substituted, which will fit into the plan of which we are speaking.\n\n33. Accept without pride, relinquish without a struggle.\n\n34. If you have ever seen a dismembered hand or foot or a head cut off, lying somewhere apart from the rest of the trunk, you have an image of what a man makes of himself, so far as in him lies, when he refuses to associate his will with what happens and cuts himself off or when he does some unneighbourly act. You have somehow made yourself an outcast from the unity which is according to Nature; for you came into the world as a part and now you have cut yourself off. Yet here there is this admirable provision that it is in your power to make yourself once more part of the unity—God has permitted this to no other part, to come together again, once it has been severed and cut off. But consider the kindness with which he has honoured man. He has put it in his power, to begin with, not to be broken off from the Whole, and then, if he has been broken off, to come back again once more and to grow together and to recover his position as a part.\n\n35. As each reasonable creature receives the rest of his abilities from the Nature of the Whole, so have we received this ability, too, from her.[3] Just as she converts every obstacle and resistance, puts it into its place in the order of necessity and makes it a part of herself, so, too, the reasonable creature can make every obstacle material for himself and employ it for whatever kind of purpose he has set out upon.\n\n36. Do not allow the imagination of the whole of your life to confuse you, do not dwell upon all the manifold troubles which have come to pass and will come to pass, but ask yourself in regard to every present piece of work: what is there here that can\u0027t be borne and can\u0027t be endured? You will be ashamed to make the confession. Then remind yourself that it is not the future or the past that weighs heavy upon you, but always the present, and that this gradually grows less, if only you isolate it and reprove your understanding, if that is not strong enough to hold out against it, thus taken by itself.\n\n37. Is Panthea or Pergamos still sitting by the funeral bier of Verus; Chabrias or Diotimus by Hadrian\u0027s bier? Absurd! And if they were still sitting there, would the dead perceive it? And if they did perceive it, would it give them pleasure? And, if it gave them pleasure, would the mourners live for ever? Were not they too fated first to become old men and women, and then to die? And when they were dead, what would those they mourned do afterwards? This is all a smell of corruption and blood, and dust in a winding sheet.\n\n38. If you have a sharp sight; \u0027see\u0027, says he, \u0027and judge, by the wisest judgements you have\u0027.\n\n39. In the constitution of a reasonable creature I see no virtue able to oppose justice: but I see one able to oppose pleasure, self-control.\n\n40. If you cancel your judgement about what seems to pain you, you yourself stand firm on surest ground. \u0027What is self?\u0027 \u0027Reason.\u0027 \u0027But I am not reason.\u0027 \u0027Granted; then do not let reason itself trouble itself, but if some other part of you is harmed, let it form its own judgement about itself.\u0027\n\n41. An obstacle to sense perception is injurious to animal nature; an obstacle to impulse is equally injurious to animal nature. (And something else may similarly be an obstacle and injurious to the constitution of a plant). Thus then an obstacle to reason is injurious to a reasoning nature. Transfer, therefore, all these considerations to yourself. Perhaps pain and pleasure are affecting you. Sense affection must look to it. Did an obstacle oppose your impulse? If you started out to satisfy it without mental reservation, the obstacle is at once injurious to you as a reasonable being; but if you experience the general lot, you are not yet hurt or hindered. The properties of the mind, you know, no one else is wont to hinder, for neither fire nor steel nor despot nor abuse affect it one whit, when it has become \u0027a sphere rounded and at rest\u0027.\n\n42. I do not deserve to give myself pain, for I never deliberately gave another pain.\n\n43. One thing gives joy to one man, another to another; it is my joy if I keep my governing self intact, not turning my back on any human being nor on anything that befalls men, but seeing everything with kind eyes, welcoming and employing each occasion according to its merits.\n\n44. See that you bestow this present time upon yourself. Those who rather run after fame in the future leave out of account that men hereafter will be just such others as these whom they find hard to bear, and those men, too, will be liable to death. What, after all, is it to you if men hereafter resound your name with such and such voices or have such and such a judgement about you?\n\n45. \u0027Take me up and cast me where you please.\u0027 For there I shall keep the divinity within me propitious; satisfied, that is, if it should behave and act consistently with its own constitution.\n\nIs this a sufficient reason why my soul should be in evil case, should lower itself, be humbled, craving, fettered, fluttering? What will you discover to be a sufficient reason for that?\n\n46. Nothing can happen to any human being which is not an incident appropriate to man, nor to an ox which is not appropriate to oxen, nor to a vine which is not appropriate to vines, nor to a stone which is not peculiar to a stone. If then that happens to each which is both customary and natural, why should you be discontented with your lot? For the Universal Nature did not bring to you what you could not bear.\n\n47. If you suffer pain because of some external cause, what troubles you is not the thing but your decision about it, and this it is in your power to wipe out at once. But if what pains you is something in your own disposition, who prevents you from correcting your judgement? And similarly, if you are pained because you fail in some particular action which you imagine to be sound, why not continue to act rather than to feel pain? \u0027But something too strong for you opposes itself\u0027. Then do not be pained, for the reason why the act is not done does not rest with you. \u0027Well, but if this be left undone, life is not worth living.\u0027 Depart then from life in a spirit of good will, even as he dies who achieves his end, contented, too, with what opposes you.\n\n48. Remember that the governing self becomes invincible when it withdraws into itself and is satisfied with itself, doing nothing which it does not will to do, even if its opposition is unreasonable. How much more then when it decides both with reason and circumspection about a given case? On this account the understanding free from passions is a citadel of refuge; for man has nothing stronger into which to retreat and be thereafter inexpugnable. He then who has not seen this is uninstructed; he who has seen it and does not retreat is unfortunate.\n\n49. Do not say more to yourself than the first impressions report. You have been told that some one speaks evil of you. This is what you have been told; you have not been told that you are injured. I see that the little child is ill; this is what I see, but that he is in danger I do not see. In this way then abide always by the first impressions and add nothing of your own from within, and that\u0027s an end of it; or rather one thought you may add, as one who is acquainted with every change and chance of the world.\n\n50. The cucumber is bitter? Put it down. There are brambles in the path? Step to one side. That is enough, without also asking: \u0027Why did these things come into the world at all?\u0027 Because the student of Nature will ridicule the question, exactly as a carpenter or cobbler would laugh at you if you found fault because you see shavings and clippings from their work in their shops. Still, they do have a place to throw rubbish into, whereas Universal Nature has nothing outside herself, and yet the astonishing thing in her way of working is that, having fixed her own limits, she is ever changing into herself everything within those limits that looks as though it were going bad and getting old and useless, and out of these very things creating again others that are young, in order that she may need no substance from outside nor require any place to throw away what begins to decay. Thus she is satisfied with her own room, her own material and her own way of working.\n\n51. Be not a sluggard in action nor confused in conversation nor wandering in imagination. Briefly, neither contract into yourself nor boil over in spirit nor in your mode of life leave no room for leisure.\n\n\u0027They kill you, cut you in pieces, pursue you with curses.\u0027 What has this to do with your understanding abiding pure, sane, temperate, and just? As if a man should stand by a sweet and crystal spring of water and curse it, but it never ceases bubbling up in water fresh to drink, and if he throw in mud or dung, it will quickly break it up and wash it away and will in no way be discoloured. How then shall you possess an everflowing fountain, not a mere cistern? If you guard yourself every hour unto freedom, contentedly, too, simply and reverently.\n\n\n52. He who does not know that the Universe exists, does not know where he is. He who does not know the purpose of the Universe, does not know who he is nor what the Universe is. He who fails in any one of these respects could not even declare the purpose of his own birth. What then do you imagine him to be, who shuns or pursues the praises of men who applaud, and yet do not know either where they are or who they are?\n\n\n53. Do you wish to be praised by a man who curses himself three times every hour? Do you wish to please a man who doesn\u0027t please himself? Does a man please himself who repents of nearly everything that he does?\n\n\n54. No longer merely breathe with the atmosphere that surrounds you, but now think also with the mind that surrounds all things. For the power of mind is as much poured out everywhere and distributed for him who is willing to absorb it, as the power of atmosphere for him who is able to respire it.\n\n\n55. In general evil does no injury to the Universe, and particular evil does no injury to a neighbour, but only injures him to whom it is permitted to be delivered from it as soon as ever he himself determines.\n\n\n56. To my will the will of a neighbour is as indifferent as his vital spirit and his flesh. For even though we were brought into the world more than anything else for the sake of one another, still each of our governing selves has its own sovereign right; for otherwise the evil of my neighbour would surely be evil of mine, and that was not God\u0027s good pleasure, in order that my unhappiness might not depend on someone other than myself.\n\n57. The sun appears to be poured down and indeed is poured in every direction but not poured out. For this pouring is extension, and so its beams are called rays from their being extended. Now you may see what kind of thing a ray is by observing the sun\u0027s light streaming through a chink into a darkened room. For it is stretched in a straight line, and rests so to speak upon any solid body that meets it and cuts off the flow of air beyond.[4] It rests there and does not glide off or fall. The pouring and diffusion of the understanding then should be similar, in no way a pouring out, but an extension, and it should not rest forcibly or violently on obstacles that meet it nor yet fall down, but stand still and illuminate the object that receives it; for that which does not reflect it will rob itself of the light.\n\n58. He who fears death fears either total loss of consciousness or a change of consciousness. Now if you should no longer possess consciousness, you will no longer be aware of any evil; alternatively, if you possess an altered consciousness, you will be an altered creature and will not cease from living.\n\n59. Men have come into the world for the sake of one another. Either instruct them then or bear with them.\n\n60. An arrow\u0027s path and the mind\u0027s path are different. Nevertheless, both when it is on its guard and when it revolves round a subject of inquiry, the path of mind is none the less direct and upon its object.\n\n61. Enter into the governing self of every man and permit every other man to enter into your own.",

It\u0027s all patterns you\u0027ve seen before, nothing truly new to freak out about.\n7.  **Original:** Nature satisfied when well; rational nature well when assents only to true/clear, directs impulse socially, desires/avoids only what\u0027s in power, welcomes Nature\u0027s assignments. Man\u0027s nature part of unhindered, just Nature, assigning shares impartially. Don\u0027t compare item-to-item, but wholes.\n    *   **Bro:** Anything natural is good when it thrives. A rational mind thrives when it: 1) Doesn\u0027t buy into false or fuzzy ideas. 2) Aims its efforts towards helping others. 3) Only wants or avoids what it actually controls. 4) Accepts whatever the Universe throws its way. Your nature is part of the bigger, unstoppable, fair system that gives everyone their share. Don\u0027t nitpick details comparing one thing to another; see if the overall package makes sense.\n8.  **Original:** Can\u0027t read? Can still control arrogance, rise above pleasure/pain, be superior to fame, not be angry with difficult people, even care for them.\n    *   **Bro:** So maybe you\u0027re not book-smart. Okay. But you *can* stop being arrogant. You *can* master pleasure and pain. You *can* rise above needing fame. You *can* deal with assholes without losing your cool, and maybe even try to help them. You have *those* powers.\n9.  **Original:** Stop complaining about palace life; don\u0027t even hear yourself do it.\n    *   **Bro:** No more whining about your fancy life/job. Don\u0027t even let *yourself* hear that crap anymore.\n10. **Original:** Regret \u003d blaming self for missing something useful. Good \u003d useful for a good man. No good man regrets missing pleasure. Therefore, pleasure isn\u0027t useful or good.\n    *   **Bro:** Regret is kicking yourself for missing something actually *useful*. A truly good thing is useful and worthy of a good person\u0027s attention. Would a genuinely good person regret missing out on some fleeting pleasure? Nah. So, that pleasure isn\u0027t truly useful or good in the big picture.\n11. **Original:** Analyze constitution, substance, cause, function, duration of a thing.\n    *   **Bro:** What *is* this thing, really? What\u0027s it made of? What caused it? What\u0027s its job in the world? How long will it last? Break it down.\n12. **Original:** Hard to wake up? Remember social acts are your nature, sleep is shared with animals. What\u0027s natural is closely related and agreeable.\n    *   **Bro:** Dragging yourself out of bed? Remember: helping others, interacting socially – that\u0027s core human stuff. Just sleeping? Even animals do that. What\u0027s truly *natural* for you should feel more aligned, more fitting, even more satisfying.\n13. **Original:** Test every impression by physics, ethics, logic.\n    *   **Bro:** Every time a strong impression hits you, run it through a quick check: Physics (What\u0027s physically happening?), Ethics (What\u0027s the right/wrong here?), Logic (Does this actually make sense?).\n14. **Original:** Meet someone? Ask their principles on good/evil (pleasure/pain, honor/dishonor, death/life). Understand their actions won\u0027t be surprising then. Remember they *have* to act based on their beliefs.\n    *   **Bro:** When you meet someone, immediately ask yourself: \"What\u0027s this person\u0027s rulebook for good/bad? What do they value or fear?\" If you figure out their views on pleasure, pain, status, life, death – then their actions won\u0027t shock you. You\u0027ll realize they\u0027re just acting according to their (maybe flawed) programming.\n15. **Original:** Don\u0027t be surprised figs grow on fig trees. Don\u0027t be surprised patients get fevers or ships face headwinds. It\u0027s natural.\n    *   **Bro:** Don\u0027t act surprised when predictable stuff happens. Fig trees make figs – duh. Doctors shouldn\u0027t be shocked by fevers; sailors shouldn\u0027t be shocked by bad weather. It’s just how things work. Stop being surprised by the nature of things (including human nature).\n16. **Original:** Changing course based on correction isn\u0027t less free. It\u0027s *your* action based on *your* impulse/decision/mind.\n    *   **Bro:** Changing your mind when someone shows you a better way doesn\u0027t make you weak or less free. It\u0027s *your* choice, *your* thinking adapting. That\u0027s strength.\n17. **Original:** If decision is yours, why do it badly? If another\u0027s, who to blame? Atoms/gods? Madness. Blame no one. Fix the person if possible. If not, fix the situation. If not, what\u0027s the point of blaming? Act purposefully.\n    *   **Bro:** If it\u0027s your call, make the right one. If it\u0027s someone else\u0027s screw-up, who are you gonna blame? Random chance? The gods? That\u0027s crazy talk. Blame *no one*. If you can, help the person fix their thinking. If not, fix the problem itself. If you can\u0027t even do that, why waste energy blaming? Do things with a purpose, or don\u0027t bother.\n18. **Original:** What dies stays in the Universe, changes, resolved into elements (of Universe and self). Elements change without grievance.\n    *   **Bro:** Things that die don\u0027t just vanish from the universe. They stay here, change form, break down into the basic building blocks – the same blocks that make up you and everything else. And those basic blocks? They change constantly and don\u0027t complain about it.\n19. **Original:** Everything has a purpose (horse, vine, Sun, gods). What\u0027s *your* purpose? Just pleasure? Does that even compute?\n    *   **Bro:** Everything exists for a reason – a horse, a grapevine. The Sun has a job, the gods have jobs. So, what are *you* here for? Just to feel good? Really think about that – does that idea even hold water?\n20. **Original:** Nature designed ends like beginnings/continuance (like throwing a ball). No harm/good to ball going up/down/falling. No harm/good to bubble existing/bursting. Same for candle.\n    *   **Bro:** Nature handles endings just like beginnings and middles – it\u0027s all part of the process, like throwing a ball. Is it \u0027bad\u0027 for the ball when it falls? Is it \u0027bad\u0027 for a bubble when it pops? Same for a candle burning out. It\u0027s just the natural cycle. Don\u0027t assign moral weight to it.\n21. **Original:** Turn thing inside out, see it old/sick. Praiser/praised short-lived. Rememberer/remembered short-lived. Live in corner of globe, not in accord. Earth is a point.\n    *   **Bro:** Look at things stripped bare – what are they like when old, sick, broken? The person praising and the person being praised? Both gone soon. The memory and the remembered? Same deal. We live in a tiny corner of the world, nobody agrees on everything, we don\u0027t even agree with ourselves half the time. The whole Earth is just a dot. Keep perspective.\n22. **Original:** Attend to subject, activity, doctrine, meaning. You deserve suffering if you choose to be good tomorrow instead of today.\n    *   **Bro:** Pay attention to the actual thing, the action, the principle, the meaning. If you\u0027re suffering because you put off being good, well, you earned it. Choose to be good *today*.\n23. **Original:** Acting? Relate to helping men. Accident? Accept, relate to gods/source of all.\n    *   **Bro:** Am I doing something? Connect it to helping people. Does something happen *to* me? Accept it, connect it to the bigger picture, the source of everything.\n24. **Original:** Bath \u003d soap, sweat, dirt, greasy water, disgusting. So is every piece of life/object.\n    *   **Bro:** Think about bathwater – soap scum, sweat, grime, nasty water. Gross, right? Well, zoom out. Every part of life, every object, has its \u0027gross\u0027 or mundane side when you look closely. It\u0027s just stuff.\n25. **Original:** Recounts deaths of prominent Romans and their families. Acute minds, proud people – all dead, forgotten, or myths. Remember your frame will scatter, spirit extinguish or move.\n    *   **Bro:** Remember all those famous Romans? Lucilla buried Verus, then she died. Secunda buried Maximus, then she died... it\u0027s the same story over and over. Big shots, smart guys, arrogant dudes – Charax, Demetrius, Eudaemon – all dead and gone. Some forgotten instantly, some became legends, some legends are fading now. Remember: your own body will break down, your spirit will either vanish or go somewhere else. Impermanence rules.\n26. **Original:** Man\u0027s joy \u003d doing proper work: kindness, disdain senses, discern images, meditate on Nature.\n    *   **Bro:** A person\u0027s real joy comes from doing their proper job: being kind to others, not being ruled by feelings/senses, seeing through BS mental images, and understanding Universal Nature and how it works.\n27. **Original:** Three relations: environment, divine cause, contemporaries.\n    *   **Bro:** You\u0027ve got three key relationships: 1) To your immediate surroundings. 2) To the ultimate source/cause of everything. 3) To the people alive with you right now.\n28. **Original:** Pain evil to body (let body say so) or soul. Soul can preserve calm, not judge pain evil. Judgement/impulse/desire/aversion within; evil doesn\u0027t reach there.\n    *   **Bro:** Pain is bad for the body? Let the body signal that. Is it bad for the soul? Only if you let it be. Your soul can stay calm and *not* judge the pain as a fundamental evil. All judgment, drive, desire, avoidance – that\u0027s internal. Real evil can\u0027t touch that core unless you let it.\n29. **Original:** Wipe out impressions by saying: I can block wickedness/appetite/disturbance now. See character of all, use accordingly. Remember this power.\n    *   **Bro:** Constantly clear out bad mental habits by telling yourself: \"Right now, I have the power to keep any negativity, craving, or disturbance out of my soul. I can see these things for what they are and handle them appropriately.\" Remember you have this natural ability.\n30. **Original:** Speak properly, without affectation, in senate and to all. Use true words.\n    *   **Bro:** Whether you\u0027re talking to the boss or anyone else, speak appropriately. No showing off. Use words that ring true. Be straight up.\n31. **Original:** Augustus\u0027s court – wife, family, friends, staff – all dead. Other families dead (Pompey\u0027s). Tomb inscriptions: \"Last of his line.\" Anxiety of predecessors for heirs, then line ends. Whole families gone.\n    *   **Bro:** Think of Augustus\u0027s whole crew – family, advisors, staff – all dead. Think of other dynasties – gone. Those tombstones saying \"Last one\"? Think of all the stress people went through to have heirs, only for the line to end anyway. Whole families wiped out by time.\n32. **Original:** Plan life action by action, content if each achieves end. Nothing prevents this. External obstacle? None to prevent just/temperate/reflective action. Hinders other activity? Resign, adapt, substitute new action fitting the plan.\n    *   **Bro:** Plan your life one step at a time. Be satisfied if each step achieves its goal as best it can. Nothing can stop you from *aiming* correctly. External roadblock? It can\u0027t stop you from acting justly, with self-control, and thoughtfulness *in response* to the block. Maybe it stops Plan A? Okay, adapt with acceptance and good grace to Plan B. A new right action immediately takes its place, fitting into your overall goal of living virtuously.\n33. **Original:** Accept without pride, relinquish without struggle.\n    *   **Bro:** Take wins without arrogance; let go of losses without a fight. Easy come, easy go (regarding externals).\n34. **Original:** Severed limb image for cutting self off from Nature/others via bad acts. Outcast, but can rejoin. God\u0027s kindness allows this unique ability for humans. Prevent cutoff, or rejoin if broken off.\n    *   **Bro:** Ever see a severed hand or foot? That\u0027s what you do to yourself when you refuse to accept what happens or act like a jerk to others – you cut yourself off from the natural unity. You make yourself an outcast. But here\u0027s the cool part: you *can* rejoin. Nature/God gave humans this unique ability to reconnect after being broken off. Try not to get cut off in the first place, but know you can always come back, grow back, become part of the whole again.\n35. **Original:** We receive ability from Nature to use obstacles. Nature converts obstacles into part of herself. Rational creature can make obstacles material for own purpose.\n    *   **Bro:** Just like Nature takes obstacles and incorporates them into the bigger system, *you* got the same power from Nature. You can take any setback, any resistance, and turn it into fuel, into material to work with for achieving your *real* purpose (living virtuously).\n36. **Original:** Don\u0027t let whole life\u0027s troubles confuse. Focus on present task: What\u0027s unbearable *here*? You\u0027ll be ashamed. Not past/future weighing you down, but present. Isolate present, it shrinks. Reprove mind if it can\u0027t handle isolated present.\n    *   **Bro:** Stop letting the overwhelming *idea* of your whole life\u0027s struggles crush you. Don\u0027t dwell on every past and future problem. Ask about the *present* moment, the *current* task: \"What part of *this* is actually unbearable?\" You\u0027ll probably feel silly admitting there isn\u0027t much. Remember, it\u0027s not the past or future crushing you, it\u0027s *always* the present. And the present shrinks if you just isolate it. If your mind feels weak, challenge it – can\u0027t it handle just *this* single moment?\n37. **Original:** People mourning long dead (Panthea/Verus, Chabrias/Hadrian)? Absurd! Would dead perceive? Would it please them? Would mourners live forever? Weren\u0027t they fated to die too? What would dead do then? All smell of corruption/blood/dust.\n    *   **Bro:** Are those people *still* crying over graves from years ago? Ridiculous! Even if they were, would the dead even know? If they knew, would they care? If they cared, would the mourners live forever? Weren\u0027t the mourners *also* destined to get old and die? Then what? It\u0027s all just drama around inevitable decay – smells, rot, dust.\n38. **Original:** If sharp sight, \u0027see and judge by wisest judgements\u0027.\n    *   **Bro:** If you\u0027ve got clear vision (mentally), then *use it*. See things clearly and make your wisest call.\n39. **Original:** No virtue opposes justice. Self-control opposes pleasure.\n    *   **Bro:** In a rational person\u0027s setup, there\u0027s no virtue that clashes with *fairness*. But there *is* one that clashes with *pleasure*: self-control.\n40. **Original:** Cancel judgment about pain, you stand firm. Self \u003d Reason. If not Reason, let Reason not trouble itself. Let other part judge itself if harmed.\n    *   **Bro:** Drop your judgment that something \u0027painful\u0027 is actually *bad*, and you\u0027ll be solid. \"What is \u0027you\u0027?\" Your reason. \"But I feel pain in my body!\" Okay, fine. Then don\u0027t let your *reason* get bent out of shape. If some other part (body, emotion) is hurting, let *it* have its own opinion about itself, but keep your core Reason steady.\n41. **Original:** Obstacle to sense/impulse injures animal nature. Obstacle to reason injures reasoning nature. Apply to self. Pain/pleasure affect senses. Impulse blocked? Injurious if acted without reservation. If general lot, not hurt. Mind\u0027s properties unhindered by externals (fire, steel, tyrant, abuse) when \u0027rounded sphere\u0027.\n    *   **Bro:** Blocking senses or urges harms an animal. Blocking *reason* harms a thinking being. Apply this to yourself. Pain/pleasure hits your senses? Let the senses deal. Impulse blocked? If you charged ahead recklessly, yeah, that block hurts you *as a rational being* (because you were irrational). But if you accept it as part of life\u0027s randomness, you\u0027re not truly hurt or stopped. Remember, nothing external – fire, weapons, dictators, insults – can truly mess with your *mind* once it achieves that state of internal balance and self-sufficiency (\u0027a sphere rounded and at rest\u0027).\n42. **Original:** Don\u0027t deserve self-pain, never deliberately gave others pain.\n    *   **Bro:** I don\u0027t deserve to torture myself mentally, because I never intentionally caused pain to others. (Treat yourself with the same fairness).\n43. **Original:** Different joys for different people. My joy \u003d intact governing self, not turning back on humans/events, seeing kindly, welcoming/using occasions by merit.\n    *   **Bro:** Different folks, different strokes. My joy? Keeping my head straight, not rejecting any person or any event, looking at everything with kindness, welcoming and using every situation based on its actual worth.\n44. **Original:** Bestow present time on self. Chasing future fame ignores future men are like present (hard to bear) and mortal. What\u0027s their future opinion to you?\n    *   **Bro:** Focus on giving *this present moment* to yourself. Chasing fame from future generations? You\u0027re forgetting those future people will be just as flawed and annoying as people now, and they\u0027ll die too. Seriously, what does their hypothetical opinion matter to you then?\n45. **Original:** \u0027Cast me where you please.\u0027 Keep divinity within propitious/satisfied if acts consistently with constitution. Is this event reason for soul to be evil/humbled/craving/fettered/fluttering? What reason is sufficient?\n    *   **Bro:** Throw me anywhere life wants. I\u0027ll keep my inner core (divinity) calm and satisfied, as long as *I* act consistently with my rational nature. Is *this* external event really a good enough reason for my soul to freak out, get depressed, needy, trapped, or panicked? What possible reason *could* be good enough for that?\n46. **Original:** Nothing happens to human inappropriate to man (or ox to ox, vine to vine, stone to stone). If customary/natural, why discontent? Universal Nature didn\u0027t bring unbearable.\n    *   **Bro:** Nothing can happen to you that isn\u0027t a normal part of the human experience. Just like oxen face ox stuff, vines face vine stuff, rocks face rock stuff. If it\u0027s standard operating procedure for life, why are you complaining? The universe didn\u0027t give you something you fundamentally *cannot* handle.\n47. **Original:** Pain from external? Not thing, but your decision. Wipe out decision. Pain from disposition? Correct judgment. Pained by failing sound action? Continue acting, not feeling pain. Obstacle too strong? Don\u0027t be pained, reason not done isn\u0027t you. Life not worth living if action undone? Depart life willingly, like one achieving end, content with obstacles.\n    *   **Bro:** Hurting because of something outside? It\u0027s not the thing, it\u0027s your *judgment* about it. Wipe out that judgment – you have the power. Hurting because of your own mindset? Fix your thinking. Hurting because you\u0027re failing at something worthwhile? Keep *acting*, don\u0027t just sit there feeling pain. Something blocking you that\u0027s truly beyond your control? Don\u0027t stress – the failure isn\u0027t on you. Feel like life\u0027s not worth living if you can\u0027t do that *one* thing? Then check out peacefully, like someone who finished their race, accepting even the obstacles.\n48. **Original:** Governing self invincible when withdrawn into self, satisfied, doing only what it wills (even if opposition unreasonable). Mind free from passions \u003d citadel. Strongest retreat. Uninstructed hasn\u0027t seen; seer who doesn\u0027t retreat \u003d unfortunate.\n    *   **Bro:** Your core self, your reason, becomes unbeatable when it pulls back into itself, relies on itself, and refuses to do what it doesn\u0027t rationally choose – even if its stance seems unreasonable to others. A mind free from emotional storms is a fortress. It\u0027s the strongest place you can retreat to and be safe. Anyone who doesn\u0027t get this is ignorant; anyone who gets it but doesn\u0027t use it is missing out big time.\n49. **Original:** Don\u0027t say more than first impressions. Told someone speaks ill? That\u0027s the report; not told you\u0027re injured. See sick child? See illness; don\u0027t see danger. Abide by first impressions, add nothing from within. Or add context of world\u0027s changes.\n    *   **Bro:** Stick to the raw data. Someone told you \"X said bad things about you.\" Fact: That\u0027s what you were told. *Not* a fact: You were harmed. You see your kid is sick. Fact: You see symptoms. *Not* a fact (yet): They are in mortal danger. Stick to the initial facts, don\u0027t automatically layer your own drama on top. Or, if you add anything, add the realistic context: \"Yeah, stuff like this happens in the world.\"\n50. **Original:** Bitter cucumber? Toss it. Brambles? Walk around. Enough. Don\u0027t ask \u0027Why these things exist?\u0027 Nature student laughs (like carpenter at sawdust). Nature has no outside trash bin; recycles everything internally (bad/old/useless -\u003e young/new). Satisfied with own room/material/method.\n    *   **Bro:** Cucumber\u0027s bitter? Throw it out. Thorns in the path? Step aside. That\u0027s sufficient. Stop asking \"Why does bad stuff even exist?\" A scientist would laugh at that, just like a carpenter laughs if you complain about sawdust in his shop. Nature doesn\u0027t have an outside dumpster; it recycles *everything* within itself. Things that seem bad, old, useless? Nature breaks them down and makes new stuff from them. It\u0027s self-contained, using its own space, materials, and methods.\n51. **Original:** Not sluggard in action, confused in talk, wandering in thought. Neither contract nor boil over. Leave room for leisure. They kill/cut/curse? What\u0027s that to mind staying pure/sane/temperate/just? Like cursing a spring - keeps bubbling fresh water, washes away mud/dung. How get everflowing fountain (not cistern)? Guard self hourly unto freedom, contentedly, simply, reverently.\n    *   **Bro:** Don\u0027t be lazy in your actions, muddled in your speech, or scattered in your thoughts. Don\u0027t shrink into yourself, but don\u0027t boil over either. Make time for rest. People kill you, slander you, curse you? How does that *force* your mind to stop being clear, rational, self-controlled, and fair? It\u0027s like someone cursing a freshwater spring – the spring just keeps bubbling clean water. Throw mud in? It washes it away. Want a constantly flowing inner spring, not just a stagnant pool? Guard your freedom every hour – calmly, simply, respectfully.\n52. **Original:** Don\u0027t know Universe exists? Don\u0027t know where you are. Don\u0027t know Universe purpose? Don\u0027t know who you are/what Universe is. Fail here? Can\u0027t declare own birth purpose. What of him who shuns/pursues praise of applauders who know nothing?\n    *   **Bro:** If you don\u0027t get that there\u0027s a coherent Universe, you don\u0027t know where you stand. If you don\u0027t get its purpose (rational order), you don\u0027t know who *you* are or what *it* is. If you miss this, you can\u0027t even state your own reason for being here. So what do you make of someone chasing approval from crowds who don\u0027t know where *they* are or who *they* are either?\n53. **Original:** Want praise from man cursing self 3x/hour? Want to please man not pleased with self? Does man pleased with self repent everything?\n    *   **Bro:** You want praise from someone who hates themselves multiple times a day? You want approval from someone who isn\u0027t happy with *themselves*? Is someone who regrets almost everything they do really pleased with themselves? Think about the source.\n54. **Original:** No longer merely breathe air, but think with Mind surrounding all. Mind power poured out/distributed for absorber, like air for breather.\n    *   **Bro:** Don\u0027t just breathe the physical air around you; start tapping into the universal Mind, the Reason that permeates everything. That mental power is available everywhere for anyone willing to tune in and draw from it, just like air is there for anyone who breathes.\n55. **Original:** General evil doesn\u0027t injure Universe. Particular evil doesn\u0027t injure neighbor; only him permitted to be delivered when he determines.\n    *   **Bro:** Evil, in general, doesn\u0027t actually harm the Universe itself. A specific evil act doesn\u0027t truly harm your neighbor\u0027s *core self*; it only harms the person *to whom* it happens, and they have the power to free themselves from that \u0027harm\u0027 (the judgment) whenever they decide to.\n56. **Original:** Neighbor\u0027s will indifferent as his flesh. Made for each other, but governing selves sovereign. Otherwise neighbor\u0027s evil \u003d my evil. Not God\u0027s plan, so my unhappiness not dependent on another.\n    *   **Bro:** My neighbor\u0027s choices are as separate from my core self as their physical body is. Yes, we\u0027re meant to help each other, but my mind is *my* territory, and theirs is theirs. If it weren\u0027t that way, their screw-ups would automatically be my screw-ups, my misery. That wasn\u0027t the design; my well-being isn\u0027t supposed to be hostage to someone else\u0027s actions.\n57. **Original:** Sun pours down, extends (rays). See ray via chink in dark room - straight line, rests on solid body, doesn\u0027t glide/fall. Understanding\u0027s pouring/diffusion similar: extension, not pouring out, not violent on obstacles, not falling, but stands still, illuminates receiver. Non-reflector robs self of light.\n    *   **Bro:** Sunlight pours down, extending in beams (rays). See it through a crack in a dark room: it travels straight, stops when it hits something solid, doesn\u0027t slide off. Your understanding should spread out similarly – extend, not just spill out randomly. It shouldn\u0027t crash violently against obstacles or just collapse. It should remain steady and illuminate whatever it touches. An object that doesn\u0027t reflect light simply stays dark; a mind that doesn\u0027t receive understanding stays ignorant.\n58. **Original:** Fear death \u003d fear loss of consciousness or change of consciousness. No consciousness \u003d no awareness of evil. Altered consciousness \u003d altered creature, still living.\n    *   **Bro:** Scared of death? You\u0027re scared of either 1) losing consciousness completely, or 2) having a different *kind* of consciousness. If #1, you won\u0027t be aware of anything bad anyway. If #2, you\u0027ll just be a different kind of being, but you\u0027ll still be \u0027living\u0027 in some form. So what\u0027s the terror?\n59. **Original:** Men for each other. Instruct or bear with them.\n    *   **Bro:** People are here for each other. So, either teach them better, or put up with them patiently. Those are your options.\n60. **Original:** Arrow path vs. mind path different. Mind\u0027s path, guarded/inquiring, still direct and on object.\n    *   **Bro:** An arrow flies straight physically. The mind\u0027s path works differently, but when it\u0027s focused, cautious, and investigating something, it\u0027s still heading directly towards its goal.\n61. **Original:** Enter governing self of every man; permit every other man to enter yours.\n    *   **Bro:** Try to understand the core thinking (governing self) of everyone you deal with. And be open enough that they can understand yours. Mutual understanding.",

You know you\u0027re not perfect, probably far from it, and so does everyone else. It\u0027s not easy to fake it anyway, and life\u0027s pulling you in other directions. So, ditch worrying about what people think. Just figure out what your *own nature* truly wants and live the rest of your life – however long that is – according to *that*. Nothing else should distract you. You\u0027ve already tried a bunch of dead ends – chasing logic tricks, money, fame, pleasure – none of it delivered the good life. So where is it? In doing what a human is built to do. How? By sticking to solid principles about good and bad: knowing that nothing\u0027s truly *good* for you unless it makes you fair, self-controlled, brave, and free; and nothing\u0027s truly *bad* unless it does the opposite.\n2.  **Quick Gut Check on Actions:** Before you do anything, ask: \"How does this line up with *me*? Will I regret this later? Look, I\u0027m gonna be dead soon, and all this stuff disappears. So, what more do I need than just doing solid work *right now* – the work of a thinking, social creature living under the same rules as everyone else?\"\n3.  **Big Shots vs. Real Thinkers:** Alexander, Caesar, Pompey – yeah, famous names. But stack \u0027em against guys like Diogenes, Heraclitus, Socrates? Those thinkers actually *understood* reality, its causes, its substance. Their minds were their own. The famous rulers? They were constantly worrying about a million external things, basically slaves to circumstance and their possessions.\n4.  **They\u0027ll Do Them Anyway:** You can absolutely lose your mind over what other people do, get totally worked up... and they\u0027re still gonna do exactly what they were gonna do. Your outrage changes nothing for them.\n5.  **Stay Calm, Know Your Job:** First rule: don\u0027t get rattled. Everything follows the grand plan of Nature, and in a blink, you\u0027ll be gone, just like Hadrian and Augustus. Gone. So, look hard at the situation, get its core truth. Remind yourself: your mission is to be a good person. Figure out what human nature actually asks of you, and *do that*, no excuses. Speak what seems right and just, but do it with kindness, humility, and zero fakeness.\n6.  **Nature\u0027s Shuffle:** The Universe\u0027s job is constant change: moving things from here to there, transforming them, taking them away, bringing new stuff in. It\u0027s all just shuffling the deck. The assignments might seem random, but they\u0027re impartial. It\u0027s all familiar patterns, nothing truly new under the sun to be terrified of.\n7.  **What Makes a Rational Mind Thrive:** Anything in nature is content when it\u0027s doing well according to its design. A rational mind does well when it: a) Doesn\u0027t buy into lies or fuzzy thinking. b) Directs its energy towards helping the team (society). c) Only desires or avoids things genuinely within its control. d) Welcomes whatever the universe deals out. Your nature is part of that big, unstoppable, fair system, just like a leaf is part of a plant (except your nature is rational and free, unlike the leaf\u0027s). It dishes out time, stuff, causes, actions, experiences fairly, according to worth. Don\u0027t get bogged down comparing tiny details; check if the whole picture makes sense.\n8.  **Play the Hand You\u0027re Dealt (Inner Strengths):** Okay, maybe you\u0027re not a genius scholar, can\u0027t read super fast. Fine. But you *can* curb your arrogance. You *can* rise above being jerked around by pleasure and pain. You *can* be indifferent to fame. You *can* choose not to get pissed off at clueless or ungrateful people, and maybe even try to look out for them. Focus on the powers you *do* have.\n9.  **Zero Whining Allowed:** Let nobody – not even yourself – hear you complaining about your life situation (even if it\u0027s a \u0027palace\u0027). Shut that down.\n10. **Regret is Pointless for Pleasure:** Regret means blaming yourself for missing something genuinely useful. Real good has to be useful and worth a truly good person\u0027s time. Would a truly good person beat themselves up for missing out on some fleeting pleasure? Hell no. Therefore, that kind of pleasure isn\u0027t genuinely useful or fundamentally good.\n11. **Break It Down:** What is this thing, really? On its own? What\u0027s its core substance? What caused it? What\u0027s its purpose in the world? How long is it designed to last? Analyze it.\n12. **Why Getting Up Matters:** Tough time waking up? Remember this: getting up and doing social things, contributing – that\u0027s core to your human design. Just sleeping? Animals do that too. What\u0027s truly aligned with your *nature* should feel more essential, more fitting, even ultimately more satisfying.\n13. **Triple-Check Your Thoughts:** Constantly, maybe every time a strong thought or feeling hits you, run it through these filters: 1) Physics (What are the physical facts?). 2) Ethics (What\u0027s the right way to handle this?). 3) Logic (Does this thought actually make sense?).\n14. **Know Their Operating System:** Meet someone new? Immediately try to figure out: \"What are this person\u0027s core beliefs about good/bad, pleasure/pain, status, life/death?\" Because if you understand their \u0027operating system,\u0027 their actions won\u0027t surprise you. You\u0027ll just recognize they\u0027re acting according to their programming, flawed or not.\n15. **Stop Being Surprised by the Obvious:** It\u0027s absurd to be shocked that fig trees bear figs. It\u0027s just as absurd for a doctor to be shocked by a fever, or a sailor by a headwind. Stop being surprised when things act according to their nature – including people.\n16. **Changing Your Mind is Freedom:** Realizing you\u0027re wrong and following someone who corrects you doesn\u0027t make you less free. That change *is* your own action, based on your own impulse, your own decision, your own rational mind adapting. That\u0027s exercising your freedom.\n17. **Blame Game is Stupid:** If the decision is yours, why screw it up? If it\u0027s someone else\u0027s fault, who are you gonna blame? Random atoms? The gods? Both are insane. Blame *no one*. If you can, correct the person. If not, correct the situation itself. If you can\u0027t even do that, what\u0027s the point of blaming? It achieves nothing. Do things with a purpose.\n18. **Nothing Leaves the Universe:** Stuff that dies doesn\u0027t fall off the map. It stays here, changes form, breaks down into the basic elements – the same elements that make up you and everything else. And those elements? They change constantly and don\u0027t throw a fit about it.\n19. **What\u0027s Your Purpose? (Hint: Not Just Fun):** Everything has a purpose – a horse, a vine. Even the Sun god would say, \"I have a job.\" The other gods too. So, what are *you* here for? Just to enjoy yourself? Does that idea even stand up to scrutiny?\n20. **Beginnings, Middles, Ends - All Natural:** Nature designed endings just like beginnings and the stuff in between. It\u0027s like throwing a ball – is it \u0027good\u0027 for the ball to go up? \u0027Bad\u0027 for it to come down? \u0027Bad\u0027 for a bubble to pop? Same for a candle burning out. It\u0027s just the natural process. Don\u0027t make it a moral drama.\n21. **Zoom Out: See the Smallness:** Turn things inside out. See what they\u0027re like when old, sick, decaying. The praiser and the praised, the rememberer and the remembered – all gone in a flash. We live in a tiny corner of the planet, nobody agrees on everything, we barely agree with ourselves. The whole Earth is just a speck. Keep perspective.\n22. **Focus on What Matters:** Pay attention to the actual subject, the action needed, the underlying principle, or the real meaning. If you choose to be good *tomorrow* instead of *today*, you deserve the friction you feel.\n23. **Connect Actions \u0026 Events:** Am I *doing* something? I frame it in terms of helping people. Does something *happen to* me? I accept it, framing it as part of the bigger picture, linked to the source of all things.\n24. **Life\u0027s Grimy Details:** Think about taking a bath – soap, sweat, dirt, oily water, kinda gross when you break it down. Well, every part of life, every object, has that mundane, \u0027unglamorous\u0027 aspect if you look closely enough. It\u0027s just reality.\n25. **Everyone Dies - Even the Smart \u0026 Proud:** Remember Lucilla burying Verus, then dying? Secunda burying Maximus, then dying? Antoninus burying Faustina, then dying? Same story, repeat forever. Celer buried Hadrian, then died. Where are those sharp minds now? The fortune-tellers? The arrogant big shots like Charax, Demetrius, Eudaemon? All short-lived, dead long ago. Some forgotten instantly, some just legends now, some legends even fading. Remember this: Your own body is destined to break apart, your spirit to be extinguished or maybe relocated. Impermanence is king.\n26. **The Real Joy of Being Human:** A person\u0027s true happiness comes from doing their proper work: being kind to fellow humans, mastering sensory impulses, seeing through fake mental images, and contemplating Universal Nature and how it operates.\n27. **Your Three Connections:** You exist in relation to three things: 1) Your immediate environment/circumstances. 2) The divine source/cause from which everything flows. 3) The other people alive right now alongside you.\n28. **Pain Can\u0027t Touch Your Core:** Pain might be bad for the body – let the body signal that. But the soul? It has the power to stay calm and *not* judge pain as an ultimate evil. All your judgments, impulses, desires, and avoidances are *internal*. Nothing truly evil can force its way into that inner sanctum.\n29. **Mental Hygiene Power:** Wipe out negative mental impressions constantly. Tell yourself: \"Right now, it\u0027s in my power to refuse entry to any wickedness, any uncontrolled appetite, any disturbance in my soul. I can see these things for what they are and use each according to its actual worth.\" Remember you have this natural power.\n30. **Speak Plainly, Speak Truly:** Whether you\u0027re in the boardroom (Senate) or talking to anyone else, speak appropriately, without putting on airs. Use words that are straightforward and true.\n31. **Entire Courts Die Out:** Think of Augustus\u0027s whole world – wife, daughter, grandkids, stepkids, sister, buddies like Agrippa, advisors like Maecenas, doctors, priests – that entire court is dead. Now think of other powerful families, like Pompey\u0027s – whole lines wiped out. Remember those tomb inscriptions: \"Last of his line.\" Imagine the anxiety of previous generations trying to secure an heir, only for it to end anyway. Whole family trees, gone.\n32. **Plan Action by Action, Adapt:** Structure your life one action at a time. Be content if each step achieves its purpose as best it can. Nobody can stop you from aiming correctly. An external obstacle blocks Plan A? Fine. It *cannot* block you from acting justly, temperately, and thoughtfully *in response*. Maybe it hinders that specific *activity*? Okay. Accept the obstacle, adapt gracefully to what *is* possible, and substitute a new right action (Plan B) that fits into your overall goal of living well.\n33. **Take It or Leave It (Externals):** Accept good fortune without pride; let go of things without clinging or struggle.\n34. **Rejoining the Whole:** Ever seen a severed limb lying separate? That\u0027s what you do to yourself, metaphorically, when you fight reality or act antisocially – you cut yourself off from the natural unity. You were born a part; now you\u0027ve made yourself an outcast. But here’s the amazing thing: unlike a physical limb, you *can* rejoin the whole. Nature/God gave humans this unique ability. Try not to sever yourself in the first place, but if you do, know you can always reconnect, grow back, and reclaim your place as a contributing part.\n35. **Turn Obstacles into Fuel:** Just like Nature takes roadblocks and incorporates them into its own system, you got the same power from her. You, as a rational being, can take *any* obstacle and make it material, use it as fuel for whatever purpose (virtuous action) you were originally aiming for.\n36. **Focus on the Present Burden:** Don\u0027t let the vague idea of *all* your life\u0027s problems overwhelm you. Don\u0027t get lost in past regrets or future anxieties. For *every present task*, ask yourself: \"What part of *this specific thing* is actually unbearable?\" You\u0027ll likely be embarrassed to admit, \"Not much.\" Remember: it\u0027s not the past or future crushing you, it\u0027s *always* the present moment. And the present shrinks if you just isolate it. If your mind feels weak facing it, call it out: \"Seriously, you can\u0027t handle just *this*?\"\n37. **Absurdity of Endless Mourning:** Are Panthea or Pergamos *still* sitting by Verus\u0027s tomb? Chabrias or Diotimus by Hadrian\u0027s? That\u0027s absurd! If they were, would the dead even know? If they knew, would they care? If they cared, would the mourners live forever? Weren\u0027t they *also* fated to get old and die? And after they died, what then? This obsessive grieving is just focusing on decay – stink, blood, dust.\n38. **See Clearly, Judge Wisely:** If you\u0027ve got sharp insight, then *use it*. See things as they are and make the wisest judgment call you can.\n39. **Justice vs. Pleasure:** In the setup of a rational being, I see no virtue that naturally opposes justice/fairness. But I *do* see one that opposes pleasure: self-control.\n40. **Your Judgment IS the Pain:** Cancel your *judgment* about the thing that seems to be causing you pain, and *you yourself* stand firm, unshaken. \"What is \u0027yourself\u0027?\" Reason. \"But I\u0027m not *just* reason!\" Okay, granted. Then don\u0027t let your Reason itself get troubled. If some other part of you (body, emotions) feels harmed, let *that part* form its own opinion about itself, but keep your core Reason steady.\n41. **What *Really* Gets Hindered?:** Blocking senses or impulses harms an animal\u0027s nature. Blocking *reason* harms a rational nature. Apply this: Pain and pleasure might affect your senses – let the senses report that. Was your impulse blocked? If you were charging ahead without thinking (without reservation), then yes, the block *is* harmful to you *as a rational being* (because you acted irrationally). But if you accept it as just how things go sometimes, you aren\u0027t truly hurt or hindered. Remember, the core properties of your mind – your reason, judgment – nobody else can really mess with. Fire, steel, tyrants, insults – they can\u0027t touch it once it becomes that stable, self-contained \u0027sphere\u0027.\n42. **Don\u0027t Inflict Pain on Yourself:** I don\u0027t deserve to cause myself mental anguish, because I\u0027ve never intentionally caused others pain. (Treat yourself fairly).\n43. **My Joy: Inner Integrity \u0026 Acceptance:** Different things make different people happy. My joy comes from keeping my core self (governing reason) intact: not turning my back on any person or any event that happens, but seeing everything with kind eyes, welcoming each situation, and using it according to its actual value.\n44. **Forget Future Fame, Focus Now:** Make sure you use this present time for *yourself*. People chasing fame from future generations forget that those future people will be just like the flawed folks around now (whom they probably find annoying!), and *they* will be mortal too. What earthly good is their hypothetical future opinion of you going to do *you*?\n45. **Inner Peace Anywhere:** \"Throw me wherever you want.\" I can keep my inner divinity calm and satisfied there, as long as *I* act consistently with my own rational constitution. Is *this* external situation really a good enough reason for my soul to be messed up – degraded, humbled, needy, trapped, panicking? What possible reason could justify that?\n46. **It\u0027s Just Human Stuff:** Nothing can happen to a person that isn\u0027t part of the normal human experience. Just like oxen deal with ox stuff, vines with vine stuff, stones with stone stuff. If what\u0027s happening is standard and natural for your kind, why are you freaking out? Universal Nature didn\u0027t give you something you fundamentally cannot bear.\n47. **Your Judgment is the Escape Hatch:** If you\u0027re suffering because of something external, remember: the thing itself isn\u0027t the problem, your *judgment* about it is. You can wipe out that judgment *right now*. If the pain comes from your own mindset, who\u0027s stopping you from correcting your thinking? If you\u0027re pained because you\u0027re failing at some action you believe is right, why not keep *acting* instead of just feeling pain? \"But there\u0027s an obstacle I can\u0027t overcome!\" Fine, then don\u0027t be pained – the reason the action isn\u0027t done isn\u0027t your fault. \"But life isn\u0027t worth living if I can\u0027t do this!\" Okay, then check out peacefully, like someone finishing their race, content even with the things that opposed you.\n48. **Reason: Your Inner Fortress:** Remember, your core self – your reason – becomes invincible when it retreats into itself, is satisfied with itself, and does only what *it* wills (even if that seems stubborn to others). How much more powerful is it when it makes decisions rationally and carefully? Because of this, a mind free from emotional chaos is a fortress. You have no stronger place to retreat where you\u0027ll be truly safe. Anyone who hasn\u0027t seen this is ignorant; anyone who sees it but doesn\u0027t retreat there is tragically missing out.\n49. **Stick to First Reports:** Don\u0027t add layers of drama to the initial facts. Someone tells you, \"So-and-so is talking trash about you.\" Okay, that\u0027s the report. You *haven\u0027t* been told you were actually harmed. You see your kid is sick. Okay, you see symptoms. You *don\u0027t* automatically see mortal danger. Stick to these first impressions, add nothing extra from your own head, and that\u0027s it. Or, maybe add one thing: the calm understanding that this kind of stuff happens in the world.\n50. **Nature\u0027s Recycling Plant:** Cucumber\u0027s bitter? Toss it. Brambles in the way? Step around them. Enough said. Don\u0027t get bogged down asking, \"Why does stuff like this even exist?\" A student of nature would laugh – like a carpenter would laugh if you complained about sawdust in their workshop. Sure, they have trash cans, but Universal Nature has nothing *outside* herself. The amazing thing is how she works: she sets limits, then constantly transforms everything within those limits that seems to be decaying, old, or useless, and creates new, young things out of the very same material. She doesn\u0027t need external resources or a place to dump waste. She\u0027s self-sufficient with her own space, her own matter, her own methods.\n51. **Stay Sharp, Stay Calm, Stay Free:** Don\u0027t be lazy in action, confused in speech, or wandering in your thoughts. Basically: don\u0027t withdraw into a shell, don\u0027t explode with emotion, and make sure you leave room for rest in your life. People kill you, cut you up, curse you? What does that *have* to do with your mind staying pure, sane, self-controlled, and just? It\u0027s like someone standing by a clear, sweet spring and cursing it. The spring keeps bubbling up fresh water. Throw mud or crap in it? It quickly breaks it down, washes it away, and stays clean. How do you get that kind of inner, ever-flowing fountain (not just a stagnant tank)? By guarding your freedom every hour, staying content, simple, and aligned with nature (reverent).\n52. **Know Your Place, Know Yourself:** If someone doesn\u0027t know the Universe exists (as an ordered whole), they don\u0027t know where they are. If they don\u0027t know its purpose, they don\u0027t know who *they* are or what the Universe is. Fail on any of these, and you couldn\u0027t even state your own reason for being born. So what do you think of someone who avoids criticism or chases praise from people who applaud, yet don\u0027t know where *they* are or who *they* are?\n53. **Consider the Source of Praise:** Do you really want praise from someone who curses themselves three times an hour? Do you want to please someone who isn\u0027t pleased with *themselves*? Is someone who regrets almost everything they do actually pleased with themselves? Think about it.\n54. **Breathe the Cosmic Mind:** Don\u0027t just breathe the physical air around you; start thinking with the universal Mind that surrounds everything. That mental power is poured out everywhere, available for anyone willing to absorb it, just like air is available for anyone able to breathe it.\n55. **Evil\u0027s Limited Reach:** Generally, evil doesn\u0027t harm the Universe itself. And specifically, a particular evil doesn\u0027t harm your neighbor\u0027s *core self*. It only \"injures\" the person it happens to, and they have the power to free themselves from that perceived injury (by changing their judgment) whenever they choose.\n56. **My Mind is Mine, Yours is Yours:** My neighbor\u0027s choices are as indifferent to my core self as their physical body is. Yes, we were born primarily for each other\u0027s sake, but each of our minds (governing selves) is sovereign. If it weren\u0027t, my neighbor\u0027s screw-up would automatically be *my* problem, my misery. That wasn\u0027t the plan – my happiness isn\u0027t supposed to depend on someone else.\n57. **Understanding Spreads Like Light:** Sunlight seems poured down, and it extends in all directions, but it doesn\u0027t get \"used up.\" This pouring is extension – hence \"rays\" (from *extendere*). You see how a ray works: light streams through a crack into a dark room, travels straight, and stops cleanly on whatever solid object it hits, lighting it up without sliding off or falling. The way your understanding spreads should be similar: not a messy spill, but a focused extension. It shouldn\u0027t crash violently against obstacles or just give up. It should remain steady and illuminate whatever it encounters. Anything that doesn\u0027t receive the light simply remains in the dark – it robs itself.\n58. **What\u0027s to Fear in Death?:** Anyone afraid of death is afraid of either 1) losing consciousness completely, or 2) having a different *kind* of consciousness. If it\u0027s #1, you won\u0027t be aware of anything bad, so no problem. If it\u0027s #2, you\u0027ll just be a different kind of creature, and you won\u0027t stop living, just living differently. So, where\u0027s the terror?\n59. **Teach or Tolerate:** People exist for one another. So, either teach them better or patiently put up with them.\n60. **Mind\u0027s Direct Path:** An arrow\u0027s flight path is physical. The mind\u0027s path is different. But when the mind is cautious, focused, and investigating something, its path is still direct and aimed right at its objective.\n61. **Understand and Be Understood:** Make an effort to get inside the head (governing self) of everyone you deal with. And let them get inside yours. Openness and understanding go both ways.",

      "text": "BOOK IX\n\n\n1. Whosoever does injustice commits sin; for Universal Nature having made reasonable creatures for the sake of one another, to benefit each other according to desert but in no wise to do injury, manifestly he who transgresses her will sins against the most venerable of the gods, because Universal Nature is a nature of what is, and what is is related to all that exists.\n\nAnd further, he who lies sins in regard to the same divine being, and she is named Truth and is the first cause of all truths. Now he who lies voluntarily commits sin in so far as by deceit he does injustice, and he who lies involuntarily sins, in so far as he is discordant with Universal Nature and creates disorder by fighting against the natural order of the Universe; for he who is carried of himself counter to truth docs so fight, since he had before received from Nature aptitudes by neglecting which he is now not able to distinguish falsehood from truth.\n\nMoreover, he who runs after pleasures as goods and away from pains as evils commits sin; for being such a man he must necessarily often blame Universal Nature for distributing to bad and good contrary to their desert, because the bad are often employed in pleasures and acquire what may produce these, while the good are involved in pain and in what may produce this.\n\nAnd further, he who fears pains will sometimes fear what is to come to pass in the Universe, and this is at once sinful, while he who pursues pleasures will not abstain from doing injustice, and this is plainly sinful. But those who wish to follow Nature, being like-minded with her, must be indifferent towards the things to which she is indifferent, for she would not create both were she not indifferent towards both. Whosoever, therefore, is not himself indifferent to pain and pleasure, death and life, honour and dishonour, which Universal Nature employs indifferently, plainly commits sin.\n\nAnd by \u0027Universal Nature employing these indifferently\u0027, I mean that in the natural order they happen indifferently to what comes to pass and follows upon an original impulse of Providence, whereby from an original cause it had an impulse to this world order, having conceived certain principles of what should come to be, and appointed powers generative of substances and changes and successions of the like kind.\n\n2. A wiser man\u0027s part had been to go away from men without tasting falsehood, hypocrisy, luxury, and pride; a second-best course is to breathe your last filled at least with distaste for these things. Or is it your choice to sit down with wickedness and does not your experience even yet persuade you to flee from the plague? For corruption of understanding is much more a plague than such a distemper and change of this environing atmosphere; for this is a plague to animals, as animate beings, that is a plague to men, as human beings.\n\n3. Disdain not death, but be well satisfied with it, because this, too, is one of the things which Nature wills. For as are adolescence and old age, growth and maturity, development of teeth and beard and grey hair, begetting, conception and childbearing and the rest of the natural functions which life\u0027s seasons bring, such also is actual dissolution. This, therefore, is like a man of trained reason, not to be rash or violent or disdainful in the face of death, but to wait for it as one of the natural functions; and, as you now wait for the unborn child to come forth from your wife\u0027s womb, so expect the hour in which your soul will drop from this shell.\n\nAnd if you would have an everyday rule to touch your heart, it will make you most contented with death to dwell upon the objects from which you are about to be parted and the kind of characters with whom your soul will be no longer contaminated. For you should in no wise be offended by them, but rather both care for them and bear them gently, yet still remember that your deliverance will not be from men like-minded with yourself. This alone, if anything could, might draw you back and detain you in life, were it granted you to live with those who had adopted the same doctrines; but, as it is, you see how great is the burden in the discord of life lived with them, so that you say: \u0027Come swiftly, death, for fear I, too, forget myself.\u0027\n\n4. Whosoever does wrong, wrongs himself; whosoever does injustice, does it to himself, making himself evil.\n\n5. Often he who omits an act does injustice, not only he who commits an act.\n\n6. Sufficient are the present judgement that grasps its object, the present social act, the present disposition well satisfied with all that comes to pass from a cause outside the self.\n\n7. Wipe out imagination: check impulse: quench desire: keep the governing self in its own control.\n\n8. One vital spirit is distributed in irrational creatures: one mind spirit is divided in rational creatures; just as one element earth is in all earthy things and we see by one light and breathe one atmosphere, all that have sight and vital spirit.\n\n9. All that partake in something common to them hasten towards what is of the same kind. The earthy all tends to earth, the watery all flows together, and the nature of air is similar so that they even need things to hold them apart by compulsion. Fire rises because of the elemental fire, but is so ready to combine in combustion with all fire here below that every material that is a little too dry is easily ignited, because what hinders ignition is mixed in it in too small proportions. Therefore also, all that partakes of a common mind similarly, or even more swiftly, hastens to what is akin; for in proportion as it is superior to the rest, so is it more ready to mix and be blended with its own kind.\n\nAt any rate there were found from the first among irrational creatures, hives, and flocks, care for nestlings, and what resembles love; for already there were vital spirits there, and in the higher part the tendency to union was found raised in degree, as it was not in plants or minerals or trees. Among reasonable creatures, constitutions, friendships, households, and gatherings were found, conventions too and armistices in war. Among the yet higher, even among beings in a sense separated, there subsisted a unity such as obtains among the stars. Thus progress towards the higher was able to produce a sympathy even in what are separated.\n\nNotice then what occurs now; only intelligent creatures have now forgotten that zeal and inclination to each other, and here only you do not see concurrence. Yet even so, they are overtaken in their flight, for nature is too strong for them. Watch and you will observe what I mean; certainly one would more quickly discover something earthy not attaching itself to the earthy than man entirely cut off from man.\n\n10. Man, God, and the Universe alike bear fruit, each in the appropriate season, but if custom has come to apply the word strictly of the vine and similar fruits, no matter. Reason, too, has its fruit, for the Whole and for itself, and from reason other results similar to itself come to pass.\n\n11. If you can, change him by teaching, but if you cannot, remember that kindness was given you for this. The gods, too, are kind to such men and even co-operate with them to some objects, to health, to wealth, to reputation, so good are they to men; and you may be so too; or say, who is there to prevent you?\n\n12. Labour, not like one who is unfortunate, nor wishing to be pitied or admired: rather have only one wish: to bestir yourself or to keep quiet as the reason of the City requires.\n\n13. To-day I escaped all circumstance, or rather I cast out all circumstance, for it was not outside me, but within, in my judgements.\n\n14. All things are the same: familiar in experience, transient in time, sordid in their material; all now such as in the days of those whom we have buried.\n\n15. Things stand outside our doors, themselves by themselves, neither knowing nor reporting anything about themselves. What then does report about them? The governing self.\n\n16. Not in feeling but in action is the good and ill of the reasonable social creature; even as his excellence and his failings are not in feeling but in action.\n\n17. To the stone that is thrown up it is no ill to be carried down nor good to be carried upwards.\n\n18. Penetrate within, into their governing selves, and you will see what critics you fear, and what poor critics they are of themselves.\n\n19. All things are in change, and you yourself in continuous alteration and in a sense destruction. So, too, is the Universe as a whole.\n\n20. Another\u0027s wrong act you must leave where it is.\n\n21. The ceasing of action, impulse, judgement is a pause and a kind of death, not any evil. Now pass to the ages of your life, boyhood for instance, youth, manhood, old age; for each change of these was a death; was it anything to be afraid of? Pass now to your manner of life under your grandfather, then under your mother, then under your (adoptive) father, and when you discover many another destruction, change, and ending, ask yourself: \u0027Was it anything to be afraid of?\u0027 So then even the ceasing, pause, and change of your whole life is not.\n\n22. Make haste to your own governing self, to that of the Whole, and that of this man. To your own, to make it a righteous mind; to that of the Whole, to remind yourself what it is of which you are a part; to this man\u0027s, that you may observe whether it is ignorance or design, and may reflect at the same time that his self is of one kind with your own.\n\n23. As you are yourself a complement of a social system, so let every act of yours be complementary of a social living principle. Every act of yours, therefore, which is not referred directly or remotely to the social end sunders your life, does not allow it to be a unity, and is a partisan act, like a man in a republic who for his own part sunders himself from the harmony of his fellows.\n\n24. Children\u0027s fits of temper and dolls and \u0027spirits carrying dead bodies\u0027, so that the story of the visit to the abode of Death strikes one more vividly.\n\n25. Penetrate to the individuality of the cause and separating it from the matter, look into it; next isolate the time which at longest this individuality can by its nature subsist.\n\n26. You endure a myriad troubles because you are not content with your governing self doing the kind of things it was formed to do. But enough.\n\n27. When another blames or hates you or men express such sentiments, go to their inward selves, pass in and see what kind of men they are. You will see that you ought not to torment yourself in order that they may hold some opinion about you. You must, however, be well disposed to them; for in the natural order they are friends, and moreover the gods help them in a variety of ways, by dreams, by prophecy;—to get, however, the objects about which they are concerned.\n\n28. The rotations of the Universe are the same, up and down, from age to age.\n\nNow either the mind of the Whole has an impulse to each individual; and if that is so, welcome what it initiates; or else it had an impulse once for all and what follows is consequential upon that; and why are you anxious? And whether the Whole be God, all is well—or whether it be Chance, somehow molecules or atoms, be not yourself then ruled by Chance.\n\nIn a moment earth will cover us all, then earth, too, will change and what ensues will change to eternity and that again to eternity. A man who thinks of the continuous waves of change and alteration, and the swift passage of all mortal things, will hold them in disdain.\n\n29. The matter of the Whole is a torrent; it carries all in its stream. What then, man, is your part? Act as Nature this moment requires; set about it, if it is granted you, and don\u0027t look round to see whether any one will know. Don\u0027t hope for Plato\u0027s Utopia, but be content to make a very small step forward and reflect that the result even of this is no trifle. How cheap are these mere men with their policies and their philosophic practice, as they suppose; they are full of drivel. For who will change men\u0027s convictions? And without a change of conviction what else is there save a bondage of men who groan and pretend to obey? Go to now and talk to me of Alexander, Philip, and Demetrius of Phalerum. If they saw what Universal Nature willed and went to school to her, I will follow: but if they were actors on the world\u0027s stage, no one has condemned me to imitate them. The work of Philosophy is simplicity and self-respect; lead me not away to vainglory.\n\n30. \u0027Look from above\u0027 at the spectacle of myriad herds, myriad rites, and manifold journeying in storm and calm; diversities of creatures who are being born, coming together, passing away. Ponder, too, the life led by others long ago, the life that will be led after you, the life being led in uncivilized races; how many do not even know your name, how many will very soon forget it and how many who praise you perhaps now will very soon blame you; and that neither memorial nor fame nor anything else at all is worth a thought.\n\n31. Calm, in respect of what comes to pass from a cause outside you; justice, in acts done in accord with a cause from yourself: that is to say, impulse and act terminating simply in neighbourly conduct, because for you this is according to Nature.\n\n32. You have the power to strip off many superfluities which trouble you and are wholly in your own judgement; and you will make a large room at once for yourself by embracing in your thought the whole Universe, grasping ever-continuing Time and pondering the rapid change in the parts of each object, how brief the interval from birth to dissolution, and the time before birth a yawning gulf even as the period after dissolution equally boundless.\n\n33. All that your eyes behold will very quickly pass away, and those who saw it passing will themselves also pass away very quickly; and he who dies in extreme age will be made equal in years with the infant who meets an untimely end.\n\n34. What governing selves are theirs, what mean ends have they pursued, for what mean reasons do they give love and esteem! Accustom yourself to look at their souls in nakedness. When they fancy that their blame hurts or their praise profits, how great their vanity.\n\n35. Loss is nothing else but change. In this Universal Nature rejoices and by her all things come to pass well. From eternity they came to pass in like fashion and will be to everlasting in other similar shapes. Why then do you say \u0027all things ever came to pass badly and that all will ever be bad\u0027? So no power it seems was ever found in so many gods to remedy this, but the world is condemned to be straitened in uninterrupted evils?\n\n36. The rottenness of the matter which underlies everything. Water, dust, bones, stench. Again: marble, an incrustation of earth; gold and silver, sediments; your dress, the hair of animals; the purple dye, blood, and so all the rest. What is of the nature of breath too is similar and changing from this to that.\n\n37. Enough of this wretched way of life, of complaining and mimicry. Why are you troubled, what novelty is there in this, what takes you out of yourself? The formal side of things? Look it in the face. The material side then? Face that. Besides these there is nothing, except even now at this late hour to become simpler and better in your relation to the gods. To acquaint yourself with these things for a hundred years or for three is the same.\n\n38. If he did wrong, the harm is with him; but perhaps he did not.\n\n39. Either all comes to pass from one fountain of mind, as in a single organic body, and the part must not find fault with what is for the good of the whole; or else there are atoms, nothing but a mechanical mixture and dispersal. Why then be troubled? Say to your governing self: \u0027are you dead, gone to corruption, turned into a beast, are you acting a part, running with the herd, feeding with it?\u0027\n\n40. The gods are either powerless or powerful. If then they are powerless, why do you pray? But if they are powerful, why not rather pray them for the gift to fear none of these things, to desire none of them, to sorrow for none of them, rather than that any one of them should be present or absent? For surely if they can co-operate with man, they can co-operate to these ends. But perhaps you will say: \u0027The gods put these things in my power.\u0027 Were it not better then to use what is in your power with a free spirit rather than to be concerned for what is not in your power with a servile and abject spirit? Besides, who told you that the gods do not co-operate even in respect to what is in our power? Begin at least to pray about these things and you will see. That man prays: \u0027How may I know that woman\u0027; do you pray: \u0027How may I not desire to know her.\u0027 Another prays: \u0027How may I get rid of him\u0027; do you pray: \u0027How may I not want to be rid of him.\u0027 Another: \u0027How may I not lose my little child\u0027; do you pray: \u0027How may I not be afraid to lose him.\u0027 Turn your prayers round in this way generally and see what is the result.\n\n41. Epicurus says: \u0027In illness my conversation was not about the sufferings of my body, nor used I\u0027, he says, \u0027to talk to my visitors about such matters, but I continued to debate leading principles of science and to keep only to this, how the understanding while conscious of such changes in the mere flesh is yet undisturbed and preserves its own proper good. I did not even\u0027, he goes on, \u0027permit the medical men to give themselves airs as though they were doing some great thing, but my life passed on happily and brightly.\u0027 Do the same then as he did, in sickness if you are sick and in any other circumstance, for it is common to every school not to desert Philosophy in any at all of the accidents of life and not to gossip with the ignorant and unlearned. Be intent only on what is now being done and on the instrument you use to do it.\n\n42. Whenever you are offended by a man\u0027s shamelessness, ask yourself immediately: \u0027Is it possible then for the shameless not to be in the world?\u0027 It is not; do not then ask for the impossible; for he, too, is one of the shameless who must exist in the world. And have the same ready also for the rogue, the traitor, and every kind of wrongdoer; for directly you remind yourself that the class of such persons cannot but be, you will be gentler to them as individuals. Another useful thing is to call to mind immediately what virtue Nature gave man to meet this wrong, for she gave as an antidote against the unfeeling, mildness, against another, some other faculty, and generally speaking it is in your power to convert the man who has gone astray, for every man who does wrong is going wrong from the goal set before him and has gone astray. And what harm have you suffered? For you will find that none of those with whom you are angry has done the kind of thing by which your understanding was likely to become worse and it is there that your ills and harms have their entire existence.\n\nHow is it an evil or strange event that the uninstructed does what uninstructed men do? See whether you should not rather find fault with yourself for not expecting that he would do this wrong; for you had aptitudes from reason to enable you to argue that in all probability this man will do this wrong, and yet you forgot and are surprised that he did wrong.\n\nBut, most important of all, turn inward to your own self, whenever you blame the traitor or the ungrateful, for the fault is plainly yours, whether you trusted a man with such a disposition to keep faith or whether, when you bestowed a favour, you did not give it unreservedly or so that you received the whole fruit from your act itself then and there. For when you have done good, what more, oh man, do you wish? Is it not enough that what you did was in agreement with your nature and do you seek a recompense for this? As if the eye asked a return for seeing or the feet for walking; for just as these were made for this which they effect according to their proper constitution, and so get what is theirs, even thus man is made by Nature to be benevolent, and whenever he contributes to the common stock by benevolence or otherwise, he has done what he was constituted for, and gets what is his own.",

      "text": "Alright, let\u0027s get Book IX into that straightforward, no-nonsense \"Bro\" format.\n\n**MEDITATIONS BOOK IX - THE BRO VERSION**\n\n1.  **Doing Wrong Messes with the System (and Yourself):** Anyone who acts unfairly screws up. Why? Because the Universe (Nature) made thinking creatures to help each other out based on what\u0027s deserved, definitely *not* to harm each other. Screw with that basic principle? You\u0027re disrespecting the most fundamental reality (the gods, Nature, whatever). That\u0027s a sin against the system.\n    *   **Lying Too:** Same deal for lying. Nature/Truth is the basis of everything real. Lie on purpose? You\u0027re causing harm through deceit. Lie unintentionally? You\u0027re still out of sync, fighting against the natural order by confusing things. You got the tools from Nature to tell truth from falsehood – if you neglect them and spread BS, you\u0027re creating chaos.\n    *   **Chasing Pleasure/Avoiding Pain Blindly:** Sinful too. Why? Because if you think pleasure is the ultimate good and pain the ultimate evil, you\u0027ll constantly bitch about Nature giving good stuff (pleasure) to bad people and hard times (pain) to good people. You\u0027ll resent reality\u0027s distribution system. Plus, fear of pain leads to fearing natural events, and chasing pleasure makes you likely to act unfairly to get it. Obvious screw-up.\n    *   **The Right Way:** If you want to align with Nature, be like her: indifferent to things she treats indifferently (pain/pleasure, death/life, fame/obscurity). If you *aren\u0027t* indifferent to these externals, making them your ultimate good or bad, you\u0027re clearly out of sync – that\u0027s sinning against the natural order. Nature uses these things impartially; they just happen as consequences of the original cosmic setup.\n2.  **Better Dead Than Fake:** Best case: you leave this life without ever tasting lies, hypocrisy, excessive luxury, or arrogance. Second best: you die at least totally sick of that crap. Still choose to hang out with wickedness? Hasn\u0027t experience taught you *anything*? Flee this plague! A corrupted mind is way worse than any physical disease. Physical sickness messes with animals; mental sickness messes with *humans*.\n3.  **Accept Death Like Puberty:** Don\u0027t disrespect death, but don\u0027t cling to life either. Be cool with it. It\u0027s just another natural process, like growing up, getting old, having kids. Teeth, beard, gray hair, birth, life – dissolution is part of the same cycle. A rational person waits for it calmly, like waiting for a baby to be born. It\u0027s just your soul dropping out of its current shell.\n    *   **Everyday Comfort with Death:** Want a trick to make peace with dying? Focus on what you\u0027ll be *leaving behind* – specifically, the annoying, flawed characters your soul won\u0027t have to deal with anymore! Don\u0027t be mad at them, actually try to care for them and be patient, but remember: your release isn\u0027t from people who think just like you (that might actually make you want to stay). No, the *real* burden is the constant friction with people who *don\u0027t* get it. Seeing that makes you think: \"Come on, death, hurry up before I lose my own damn mind dealing with this!\"\n4.  **Wrongdoing Hurts the Doer:** Whoever acts wrongly, harms themselves. Whoever is unjust, does it *to themselves*, making themselves worse.\n5.  **Injustice by Not Acting:** Often, injustice isn\u0027t just doing something wrong, but *failing* to do something right when you should have. Omission counts.\n6.  **The Only Things You Need:** What\u0027s sufficient? 1) Your present judgment grasping reality accurately. 2) Your present action being socially helpful. 3) Your present attitude being okay with whatever external events happen. That’s it.\n7.  **Mental Quick-Clean:** Wipe out imagination. Stop raw impulse. Kill clingy desire. Keep your core self in control.\n8.  **Shared Resources:** Animals share one basic life force (vital spirit). Rational creatures share one mind-force (intelligence). Just like we all share one earth, see by one light, breathe one air (if we have sight and breath).\n9.  **Like Attracts Like (Especially Minds):** Everything gravitates towards its own kind. Earth to earth, water to water, air clumps together (needs force to separate). Fire rises to join cosmic fire, easily igniting dry stuff here because it wants to connect. Things sharing the *same mind-stuff* rush together even faster and more eagerly because mind is superior.\n    *   **Even Animals Get It:** Look at bees, herds, birds caring for young – even basic critters show unity. Higher up, you get communities, friendships, families, treaties. Higher still, even separate things like stars show a kind of cosmic unity. Progress towards higher states creates connection even across distance.\n    *   **Humans Forget:** Notice what\u0027s happening now? Only intelligent creatures seem to have forgotten this natural pull towards each other. Only here do you see a lack of connection. But even then, Nature\u0027s too strong – they *still* get pulled together despite themselves. Watch closely, you\u0027ll see it. It\u0027s easier to find dirt not sticking to dirt than a human totally cut off from other humans.\n10. **Everything Bears Fruit (Even Reason):** People, Gods, the Universe – they all produce results in their own season. We usually talk about \u0027fruit\u0027 for vines, etc., but that\u0027s just habit. Reason also bears fruit – for the whole system and for itself. And from Reason, other good things like it arise.\n11. **Teach or Tolerate (Again):** If you can, teach the person who\u0027s wrong. If you can\u0027t, remember kindness is your tool for this situation. Even the gods are kind to flawed people, helping them get stuff like health, wealth, reputation (they\u0027re that generous!). You can be too. Who\u0027s stopping you?\n12. **Work Without Drama:** Work hard, but not like a victim needing pity or applause. Have just one goal: to act or be still as rational, social reason requires.\n13. **Circumstance is Internal:** Today I got away from all bad circumstances. Actually, scratch that – I *threw them out*. Because they weren\u0027t *outside* me; they were *inside*, in my judgments about them.\n14. **It\u0027s All the Same Old Story:** Everything is the same pattern: familiar from experience, temporary in time, made of basic stuff. Everything now is just like it was in the time of the people we buried. Nothing new.\n15. **Things Don\u0027t Talk, Your Mind Does:** Stuff exists \u0027out there,\u0027 on its own. It doesn\u0027t know anything about itself or tell you anything. So what *does* report on it? Your own damn mind (governing self).\n16. **Good/Bad is in Action, Not Feeling:** For a thinking, social creature, good and bad aren\u0027t found in feelings, but in *actions*. Your virtue or vice shows up in what you *do*, not just how you feel.\n17. **Stone Thrown Up:** It\u0027s no evil for a stone to fall down, nor good for it to go up. It\u0027s just physics. (External events lack inherent moral value).\n18. **Look Inside Your Critics:** Penetrate into *their* minds (governing selves). You\u0027ll see what kind of judges you\u0027re actually afraid of... and how poorly they judge even themselves.\n19. **Everything Changes (Including You):** All things are in flux. You yourself are constantly changing, in a way constantly being destroyed and rebuilt. The whole universe is like that too.\n20. **Leave Their Crap With Them:** Another person\u0027s wrongdoing? You gotta leave it where it originated – with them. It\u0027s not your burden to carry internally.\n21. **Ending is Just Change, Not Evil:** Stopping an action, an impulse, a judgment – it\u0027s a pause, a kind of ending, but not an *evil*. Think about the phases of your life: childhood, youth, adulthood, old age. Each transition was an \u0027ending.\u0027 Was it scary? Now think about living under your grandfather, then mother, then father. See all those other endings and changes? Were *they* scary? So, the end, pause, or change of your *entire* life isn\u0027t inherently scary either.\n22. **Check Your Internal Compass (and Theirs):** Hurry to check in with: 1) Your own core self (make sure it\u0027s aiming for justice). 2) The core self of the Whole (remind yourself you\u0027re part of something bigger). 3) This other person\u0027s core self (try to see if they\u0027re acting from ignorance or intention, and remember their core self is fundamentally like yours).\n23. **Be a Team Player, Not a Rogue Cell:** You\u0027re a component of the social system. So, every action you take should contribute to that social system\u0027s health. Any act not aimed, directly or indirectly, at the common good rips your life apart, stops it from being unified, makes you a factionalist – like someone in a country working only for their tiny subgroup, disrupting the overall harmony.\n24. **Life\u0027s Vivid (Sometimes Creepy) Details:** Kids\u0027 tantrums, playing with dolls, maybe even those creepy ancient stories about spirits carrying corpses – sometimes vivid, even dark imagery (like visiting the underworld in myths) makes things hit home more strongly. (Acknowledge the sometimes harsh or strange realities).\n25. **Analyze Cause \u0026 Time:** Dig down to the specific cause of something. Separate it from the raw material involved. Then figure out the maximum time that specific cause or thing could naturally last.\n26. **Stop Troubling Yourself:** You suffer tons of problems because you aren\u0027t content just letting your core self do what it was designed to do. Enough already! Let it function properly.\n27. **See Their Inner Selves, Be Kind:** When someone blames you, hates you, or talks crap, go inside *their* inner selves. Penetrate their minds and see what kind of people they *really* are. You\u0027ll realize you shouldn\u0027t torture yourself worrying about their opinion. *However*, you still need to be genuinely well-disposed towards them. They are naturally your kin. Plus, the gods help them too (dreams, prophecies) to get the external stuff they\u0027re obsessed with.\n28. **Cosmic Cycles \u0026 Your Response:** The universe spins through the same cycles, up and down, age after age. Now, either the Mind of the Whole directs each individual thing (if so, accept its direction), OR it set things in motion once, and everything else follows logically (if so, why worry?). Whether the Whole is God (all good) or just random Chance (atoms mixing), don\u0027t let *yourself* be ruled by randomness.\n    *   **Dust to Dust, Swiftly:** Soon enough, dirt covers us all. Then that dirt changes, and what comes next changes, forever and ever. Thinking about these constant waves of change, how fast mortal things pass, should make you hold them lightly, without excessive attachment.\n29. **Do Your Part, Forget Utopia \u0026 Fame:** The universe is a rushing river carrying everything along. Okay, man, what\u0027s *your* role? Do what Nature needs *right now*. Get on with it, if you can, and don\u0027t look around seeking approval. Don\u0027t dream of some perfect utopia (Plato\u0027s Republic); just be content making one tiny step forward. Realize even that small step is significant. These politicians and self-proclaimed philosophers are mostly full of hot air. Who can actually change people\u0027s core beliefs? And without that change, what is there but slaves groaning and pretending to obey? Forget comparing yourself to Alexander, Philip, Demetrius. If they truly understood Nature\u0027s will and learned from her, fine, follow their example. But if they were just actors on a stage? Nobody sentenced *you* to imitate actors. The real work of philosophy is simple: integrity and self-respect. Don\u0027t let me get sidetracked by vanity.\n30. **View from Above (Again):** Look down (metaphorically) on the chaos: countless herds, rituals, journeys in storms and calm; all the different creatures being born, interacting, dying. Think about lives lived long ago, lives yet to be lived, lives in \u0027uncivilized\u0027 places. How many don\u0027t know your name? How many will forget it instantly? How many praising you now will soon blame you? Realize that memory, fame, *anything* external is ultimately not worth obsessing over.\n31. **Your Two Duties: Calm Acceptance \u0026 Just Action:** Calmness about things that happen *from outside* you. Justice in things you *do* yourself. That means your impulses and actions should end simply in helping others, because that *is* acting according to your (social) nature.\n32. **Create Inner Space:** You can strip away tons of unnecessary baggage that\u0027s troubling you – it exists entirely *in your judgment*. Do that, and you\u0027ll instantly create huge mental space for yourself by: 1) Taking in the whole Universe in your thoughts. 2) Grasping the vastness of eternal Time. 3) Pondering the rapid changes in every single object – how short the time from birth to death, how huge the void before and after.\n33. **Everyone Ends Up Equal (Dead):** Everything you see will vanish quickly. And the people who saw it vanish? They\u0027ll vanish quickly too. The person who dies super old ends up in the same state as the baby who died prematurely. Time levels everyone.\n34. **Look at Their Naked Souls:** What are their core minds (governing selves) like? What cheap goals do they chase? For what petty reasons do they love or respect things? Get used to seeing their souls stripped bare. When they think their blame hurts or their praise helps, how incredibly vain they are.\n35. **Change Isn\u0027t Loss, It\u0027s Nature\u0027s Way:** \u0027Loss\u0027 is just another word for \u0027change.\u0027 And Universal Nature *rejoices* in change; it\u0027s how everything good happens. Things have always happened this way, and they always will, in similar forms. So why whine that \u0027everything\u0027s always been bad and always will be\u0027? You think the gods are powerless to fix things, that the world is doomed to endless evils? Seriously?\n36. **The Grimy Underside of Everything:** Think about the raw material: Water, dust, bones, stench. Marble? Just dirt crust. Gold/silver? Sediment. Clothes? Animal hair. Purple dye? Shellfish blood. Your breath? Just air, changing. It\u0027s all basic stuff, constantly transforming.\n37. **Enough Whining, Get Simple:** Enough of this miserable life, the complaining, the play-acting. Why are you upset? What\u0027s so new here? What\u0027s throwing you off? The *form* of things? Look it straight on. The *material*? Face that too. Besides these, there\u0027s nothing else. It\u0027s late in the game – just aim to become simpler and better in your relationship with reality/gods. Learning this stuff for 100 years or 3 years – it\u0027s the same lesson.\n38. **Maybe They Didn\u0027t Wrong You:** If someone did wrong, the harm is with *them*. But hold on – maybe they *didn\u0027t* actually do wrong (from their perspective, or maybe you misunderstood).\n39. **One Source or Random Atoms? Doesn\u0027t Matter for Your Response:** Either everything flows from one Mind (like a body), and the part shouldn\u0027t complain about what serves the whole; OR it\u0027s just atoms, mixing and scattering randomly. Either way, why be troubled? Tell your core self: \"Are you dead? Decayed? Turned animal? Just acting? Part of the herd? Just grazing?\" (i.e., Are you letting yourself be less than rational?).\n40. **Pray for Strength, Not Stuff:** The gods are either powerless or powerful. If powerless, why pray? If powerful, why not pray for the strength *not* to fear external things, *not* to desire them, *not* to grieve over them, rather than praying for them to be present or absent? Surely, if they can help humans, they can help with *this*. Maybe you\u0027ll say, \"But the gods put these things (externals) in my power.\" Okay, isn\u0027t it better to use what *is* in your power freely, instead of desperately craving what *isn\u0027t*, like a slave? Besides, who told you the gods *don\u0027t* help with things in our power too? Start praying about *these* internal strengths, and see what happens. That guy prays: \"How can I sleep with her?\" You pray: \"How can I *not desire* to sleep with her?\" Another prays: \"How can I get rid of him?\" You pray: \"How can I *not want* to be rid of him?\" Another: \"How can I not lose my child?\" You pray: \"How can I *not be afraid* to lose him?\" Flip your prayers around this way. See the difference.\n41. **Epicurus on Handling Sickness (Focus Inward):** Epicurus said: \"When I was sick, I didn\u0027t talk about my body\u0027s pains. I didn\u0027t drone on about that stuff to visitors. I kept debating key scientific principles, focusing only on how the mind, even aware of bodily chaos, can stay undisturbed and protect its own good. I didn\u0027t let the doctors act all high and mighty either. My life went on happily.\" Do the same. Sick? Injured? Whatever? Don\u0027t abandon your philosophy. Don\u0027t gossip with ignorant people. Focus only on the task at hand and the tools (your reason) you have to do it.\n42. **Expect Shamelessness, Use Your Antidote:** Offended by someone\u0027s shameless behavior? Ask yourself immediately: \"Is it possible for shameless people *not* to exist in the world?\" No, it\u0027s not. So don\u0027t demand the impossible. This person is just one of those shameless types that are bound to exist. Have the same thought ready for rogues, traitors, every kind of wrongdoer. Reminding yourself that this *type* of person inevitably exists makes you gentler towards the *individual*.\n    *   **Nature Gave You Tools:** Remember the virtues Nature gave you to counter these flaws: mildness against the unfeeling, other tools for other wrongs. You generally *can* try to help someone who\u0027s gone astray (because wrongdoing *is* missing the mark).\n    *   **What Harm *Really* Done?:** Seriously, what harm have you suffered? You\u0027ll find none of these people you\u0027re mad at have done anything that actually made *your understanding* worse. And that\u0027s where your real harm or good resides.\n    *   **Maybe Blame Yourself for Surprise:** Is it really evil or strange that an untrained person acts like an untrained person? Maybe check yourself: shouldn\u0027t you have expected this? Reason gave you the tools to predict this probability, but you forgot and now you\u0027re shocked?\n    *   **Turn Inward on Blame (Especially Gratitude):** Most importantly, when blaming a traitor or ungrateful person, look inside yourself. The fault might be yours: did you trust someone untrustworthy? Or when you did a favor, did you do it with strings attached, not purely, not getting the *full* reward from the *act itself* right then and there? Because when you\u0027ve done good, what more do you want? Isn\u0027t acting according to your nature enough? Do you need payment for being you? Does the eye demand thanks for seeing, or feet for walking? They were made for that, they do their job, they get their reward intrinsically. Humans are made for benevolence. When you act kindly, you\u0027re doing what you were built for, and you get what\u0027s yours – the satisfaction of acting virtuously.",

      "text": "BOOK X\n\n1. Wilt thou one day, my soul, be good, simple, single, naked, plainer to see than the body surrounding thee? Wilt thou one day taste a loving and devoted disposition? Wilt thou one day be filled and without want, craving nothing and desiring nothing, animate or inanimate, for indulgence in pleasures; not time wherein longer to indulge thyself, nor happy situation of place or room or breezes nor harmony of men? Wilt thou rather be satisfied with present circumstance and pleased with all the present, and convince thyself that all is present for thee from the gods and all is well for thee and will be well whatsoever is dear to them to give and whatsoever they purpose to bestow for the sustenance of the perfect living creature, the good and just and beautiful, which begets, sustains, includes, and embraces all things that are being resolved into the generation of others like themselves? Wilt thou one day be such as to dwell in the society of gods and men so as neither to find fault at all with them nor to be condemned by them?\n\n2. Observe what your nature requires in so far as you are governed by mere physical nature; then do that and accept that, if only your nature as part of the animal world will not be rendered worse. Next you are to observe what your nature as part of the animal world requires and to take it all, if only your nature as a reasonable being will not be rendered worse. But what is reasonable is consequently also social. Make use then of these rules and do not be troubled about anything besides.\n\n3. Every event happens in such a way that your nature can either support it or cannot. If then it happens so that your nature can support it, do not complain but support it as it is your nature to do; but if so that your nature cannot support it, do not complain, for it will destroy you quickly. Remember, however, that your nature can support everything which it is in the power of your own judgement to make tolerable and endurable by representing to yourself that to do this is to your advantage or is your duty.\n\n4. If he goes wrong, instruct him kindly and point out what is being overlooked; if you fail, blame yourself or, better, not even yourself.\n\n5. Whatever befalls you was prepared for you beforehand from eternity and the thread of causes was spinning from everlasting both your existence and this which befalls you.\n\n6. Whether there are Atoms or Nature, the first postulate must be: \u0027I am part of the Whole which is governed by Nature\u0027; the second: \u0027I am allied in some way to the parts that are of the same kind with me.\u0027 For if I remember these postulates, I shall, in so far as I am a part, not be disaffected to anything assigned by the Whole; for nothing which benefits the Whole is injurious to the part, since the Whole contains nothing which does not benefit itself, and while all natural existences have this common attribute, the nature of the Universe has this farther attribute that no external cause can compel it to generate anything injurious to itself.\n\nBy remembering, therefore, that I am a part of a Whole so characterized, I shall be well-affected to all that results from it, and in as much as I am allied in some way to the parts of the same kind as myself, I will do no unsocial act, rather I will study the good of my kind and direct every impulse to the common benefit and divert it from what opposes that benefit. Now when things are being accomplished in this way, life must needs flow smoothly, just as you would see that a citizen\u0027s life is smooth as he progresses by acts which benefit his fellow-citizens and welcomes whatever his city assigns.\n\n7. The parts of the Whole, all which the Universe naturally includes, must necessarily perish, a word which is to be interpreted to denote change. Now if this were naturally evil as well as necessary for the parts, the Whole would not continue to be in a right condition while its parts were tending to change and had been put together specifically with a view to perishing. (For whether did Nature herself undertake to injure the parts of herself and to create them with a tendency to evil, and bound by necessity to fall into evil, or did such things come to pass without her knowledge? Neither view is credible.)\n\nBut now suppose one dispensed with Nature and expounded facts by way of \u0027natural law\u0027; how absurd it is in one breath to assert that the parts of the Whole change by natural law, and in the same moment to be surprised or indignant as though at an occurrence in violation of natural law, particularly when the dissolution of each is taking place into the elements out of which each is composed. For this dissolution is either a dissipation of the atoms out of which they were compounded or else a turning of the solid into its earthy and of the vital spirit into its airy part, so that these too are caught up into the Reason of the Whole, whether the Whole returns periodically to fire or is renewed by eternal exchanges.\n\nAnd do not imagine this solid body and this vital spirit to be that of its original entry into existence, for all this it took in only yesterday or the day before, an influx from foodstuffs and the atmosphere which is respired; what is changing then is what it took in, not what its mother brought into the world. And even suppose that what thus is changing binds you intimately to the individual self, that is in fact nothing, I think, to affect my present argument.\n\n8. After giving yourself these titles: good, self-respecting, true, sane, conforming, high-minded, take care not to get others in their place; and, if you do lose these titles, be quick to return to them. Remember, further, that \u0027sanity\u0027 was intended to denote apprehensive attention to individual objects and the reverse of negligence; \u0027conformity\u0027 glad acceptance of the assignments of Universal Nature; and \u0027high-mindedness\u0027 elevation of the thinking part above the smooth or interrupted movement of the flesh, above petty reputation and death and all indifferent things.\n\nTherefore, if you continue to preserve yourself in these titles, not aspiring to be called them by others, you will be a changed man and will enter upon a changed life. For still to be such as you have been up to the present, to be torn and polluted in such a way of life, is to be utterly brutalized, to cling to mere life like half-devoured combatants in the arena, a mass of wounds and dusty blood, yet imploring to be kept alive until the morrow, only to be exposed in that state to the same teeth and claws.\n\nAdventure yourself then upon these few titles, and if you are able to abide in them, abide like a man translated to Islands of the Blest; but if you perceive that you are falling away and losing control, go bravely away into some corner, there to recover control, or even depart altogether from life, not angrily, but simply and freely and with self-respect, having done at least this one thing in life, to have made your exit thus.\n\nTo remember the titles, however, it will be a great help to you to remember the gods, and that they at least do not wish to be the objects of servility, but for all rational beings to be made into their likeness, and that the fig-tree should be what does the work of a fig-tree, the dog of a dog, the bee of a bee, and man the work of a man.\n\n9. Play-acting, warfare, excitement, lethargy—in fact slavery!\n\nEvery day those sacred doctrines of yours, whichever of them you imagine and admit without scientific investigation, will be obliterated, whereas you should look at every object and do every act so that, at one and the same time, circumstance is accomplished and theory exercised, and the confidence which comes from a scientific knowledge of each experience is preserved, unnoticed, not concealed. For when will you take your indulgence in simplicity, when in dignity, when in the knowledge of what each object is in essence, what station it holds in the world, how long it naturally persists, of what it is compounded, to whom it can belong, who can give it and who take it away?\n\n10. A spider is proud when he traps a fly, a man when he snares a leveret, another when he nets a sprat, another boars, another bears, another Sarmatian prisoners. If you test their sentiments, are they not bandits?\n\n11. Acquire a methodical insight into the way all things change, one into another; attend continually to this part of Nature and exercise yourself in it, for nothing is so likely to promote an elevation of mind. He has put off the body and, reflecting that he will be bound almost at once to leave all these things behind and to depart from men, he has devoted his whole self to justice in what is being accomplished by himself, and to Universal Nature in what comes to pass otherwise. And he spends no thought about what some one may say or think about him or do against him, but is contented with these two things, if he is himself acting justly in what is done in the present, and if he embraces what is assigned to him in the present; and he has put away every preoccupation and enthusiasm, and has no other will than to pursue a straight path according to the law and, pursuing it, to follow in God\u0027s train.\n\n12. What need have you of a hint or suggestion, when it is possible to see what ought to be done and, if you are conscious of that, kindly to proceed on this path without turning back; but if you are not conscious of it, to suspend judgement and use the best men to advise you; or if some further points bar this advice, to go forward according to your present opportunities cautiously, holding fast to what seems to be just? For it is best to achieve justice, since, as you see, failure is to fail in this. The man who in everything follows the rule of Reason is at once master of his time and quick to act, at once cheerful in expression and composed.\n\n13. Ask yourself directly you awake from sleep: will it be of any moment to you, if just and right acts are blamed by another? No, it will not. Have you forgotten what these who plume themselves upon praise or censure of others are like at bed and board, the sort of things they do and avoid or pursue, how they steal and plunder, not with hands and feet, but with the most precious part of themselves, in which, whenever it determines, faith, self-respect, truth, law, a good divinity come into being?\n\n14. To Nature, who bestows all things and takes them away, the man who has learnt his lesson and respects himself says: \u0027Give what is thy good pleasure, take back what is thy good pleasure\u0027; and this he says not boasting himself but only listening to her voice and being of one mind with her.\n\n15. Small is this balance of life left to you. Live as on a height; for here or there matters nothing, if everywhere one lives in the Universe, as in a city. Let men see, let them study a true man, a man who lives in accord with Nature. If they cannot bear him, let them kill him, for it were better so than for him to live on those terms.\n\n16. Don\u0027t any more discuss at large what the good man is like, but be good.\n\n17. Let your imagination dwell continually upon the whole of Time and the whole of Substance, and realize that their several parts are, by comparison with Substance, a fig-seed; by comparison with Time, the turn of a gimlet.\n\n18. Dwell upon everything that exists and reflect that it is already in process of dissolution and coming into being by change and a kind of decay or dispersion, or in what way it is born to die, in a manner of speaking.\n\n19. What creatures they are; they eat, sleep, copulate, relieve nature, and so on; then what are they like as rulers, imperious or angry and fault-finding to excess; yet but yesterday how many masters were they slaving for and to what purpose, and to-morrow they will be in a like condition.\n\n20. Each man\u0027s benefit is what Universal Nature brings to each, and it is his benefit precisely at the time she brings it.\n\n21. \u0027Earth loves the rain\u0027: \u0027the glorious ether loves to fall in rain\u0027. The Universe, too, loves to create what is to be. Therefore I say to the Universe: \u0027Your love is mine.\u0027 Is not that also the meaning of the phrase: \u0027This loves to happen\u0027?\n\n22. Either you go on living in the world and are familiar with it by now, or you go out, and that by your own will, or else you die and your service is accomplished. There is nothing beside these three: therefore be of good courage.\n\n23. Always realize vividly the saying that one place of retreat is like any other, and how everything in the place you are in is the same as it would be on the top of a hill or by the sea or wherever you choose. You will find exactly what Plato says: \u0027building round himself a fold on a hill and milking his bleating flocks\u0027.\n\n24. What is my governing self to me, and what sort of thing am I making it now, and for what purpose am I employing it now? Is it void of reason? Is it severed and torn asunder from society? Is it so melted into and blended with the flesh that it conforms to its movements?\n\n25. He who runs away from his master is a fugitive slave. But law is a master and therefore the transgressor of law is a fugitive slave. In the same way, also, he who gives way to sorrow or anger or fear, wishes that something had not been or were not now, or should not be heareafter, of what is appointed by that which ordains all things; and that is law, laying down for every man what falls to his lot. He, therefore, who yields to fear or pain or anger is a fugitive slave.\n\n26. A man drops seed into a womb and goes his way and thereupon another causal principle takes it, labours upon it and completes a new-born babe. What a marvellous result of that small beginning. Next the babe passes food through the gullet and thereupon another causal principle takes it and creates sensation and impulse; in a word, life and strength and other results, how many and how marvellous. Contemplate, therefore, in thought what comes to pass in such a hidden way, and see the power, as we see the force which makes things gravitate or tend upwards, not with the eyes, but none the less clearly.\n\n27. Reflect continually how all things came to pass in days gone by as they do to-day, and reflect that so they will hereafter; and put before your eyes whole dramas and scenes of the same kind, which you have known in your own experience or from earlier history, the whole court of Hadrian, for instance, or of Antoninus; of Philip, Alexander, and Croesus; for those were all like these; the actors only were different.\n\n28. Picture to yourself every man who gives way to pain or discontent at any thing at all as like a pig being sacrificed, kicking and squealing. Such also is the man who groans on his bed, alone and in silence. Think of the chain we are bound by, and that to the rational creature only is it given to obey circumstances of his own will, while mere obedience is necessary for all.\n\n29. At the time of each separate act, stop and ask yourself whether death is to be feared because you are deprived of this.\n\n30. When you run against some one\u0027s wrong behaviour, go on at once to reflect what similar wrong act of your own there is; for instance, to esteem money or pleasure or glory as goods, and so on with each kind. For if you attend to this, you will quickly forget your anger, when it occurs to you at the same time that he is compelled, for what else can he do? Alternatively, if you can, remove what in him is subject to compulsion.\n\n31. When you see Satyrion, Eutyches, or Hymen, picture a follower of Socrates; or an Euphrates, when you see Eutychion or Silvanus; an Alciphron, when you see Tropaeophorus; and a Crito or Xenophon, when you see Severus. So when you look at yourself, picture one of the Caesars, and in every case picture a parallel. Then let the thought strike you in the same moment: \u0027Where are they all? Nowhere, or we know not where.\u0027 For in this way you will continually see that man\u0027s life is smoke and nothingness, especially if you remind yourself that what has once changed will be no more in infinite Time. Why then are you bothered? Why not satisfied to pass through this brief moment ordering your ways? What kind of material condition and station are you running away from? What is it all except a school of exercise for a reason which has exactly and scientifically looked into what life contains? Wait, therefore, until you assimilate even these things to yourself, as a strong stomach assimilates any food and a bright fire turns whatever you throw into it to flame and light.\n\n32. Don\u0027t let it be possible for any one to say of you truthfully that you are not simple and good, but let him be a liar who thinks any of these things about you. And this entirely rests with you; for who prevents your being good and simple? Only make up your mind not to go on living, if you are not like that, for Reason, too, disowns one who is not like that.\n\n33. What is the soundest thing that can be done or said in a given material condition? For whatever this may be, you are able to do or say it, and you are not to make the excuse that you are prevented. You will never cease groaning until you feel that to act appropriately to man\u0027s constitution in any material condition which occurs to you or befalls you is for you what luxury is to the sensualist. For you should regard as an indulgence whatever you can achieve in accord with your own nature, and this you can achieve everywhere. Now the roller is not allowed everywhere to be moved according to its own natural movement, nor are water, fire, and the rest, which are governed by natural law or life without reason—for there are many things which separate them and resist them. Mind and reason are able to move through any thing that opposes, as their nature and their will prescribe. Put before your eyes this ease with which reason will prove to be carried through all things (as fire moves upwards, a stone down, a roller on a slope) and ask for nothing more, for the remaining obstacles are either of the lifeless body or else do not overwhelm it or do any harm at all without the judgement and the consent of reason itself.\n\nFor mark you, were it not so, the man affected would have become evil at once; at all events in all other constituted things whatever is affected itself becomes worse because of any evil which happens to it, whereas in this case, if one may so put it, a man becomes better and more laudable by right use of circumstances. And generally, remember that nothing harms the natural citizen which does not harm the city and nothing harms the city which does not harm the law. Now none of what are called strokes of bad luck harms the law: wherefore, not harming the law, it harms neither city nor citizen.\n\n34. For one bitten by true doctrines even the briefest and most familiar saying is reminder enough to dispel sorrow and fear, for instance:\n\n\u0027leaves,\nthe wind scatters some on the face of the ground;\nlike unto them are the children of men.\u0027\n\nYes, \u0027leaves\u0027 too are your children, and \u0027leaves\u0027 those whose voices shout and applaud convincingly or on the contrary curse you or blame and rail beneath their breath; \u0027leaves\u0027 too even those who will receive and hand on your fame hereafter. For they all \u0027shoot in the season of spring\u0027; then the wind has thrown them down and the woodland \u0027bears others\u0027 in their stead. Brief life is the common portion of all, yet you avoid and pursue each thing as though it will be for everlasting. A little while and you will close your eyes, and now another will be lamenting him who carried you out.\n\n35. The healthy eye should be able to look at every object of sight, and not to say: \u0027I wish it were green\u0027, for this is what a man does who has ophthalmia. The healthy ear and nose must be ready for every object of hearing or smell, and the healthy stomach must be disposed to every kind of nourishment as the mill is ready for everything which it is made to grind. Accordingly the healthy understanding too must be ready for all circumstances; but that which says: \u0027may my children be kept safe\u0027 or \u0027may all men praise whatever I do\u0027, is the eye looking for green or the teeth for what is tender.\n\n36. No one is so fortunate but that when he is dying some will be at his bedside welcoming the evil that is coming to him. Was he earnest and wise; perhaps there will be someone at the end to say of him: \u0027we shall breathe more freely now this schoolmaster has gone; he was not hard on any of us, but I could feel he was tacitly condemning us.\u0027 So much for the earnest man; but in our own case what a number of other things there are for which many want to be rid of us. You will think then of this as you die and will depart more easily, thinking to yourself: \u0027I am going away from the kind of life in which even my fellow men, for whom I laboured, prayed and thought so much, even they wish me to go away, hoping perhaps for some relief by my death.\u0027 Why then should one hold on to a longer stay in this world? Do not, however, on this account leave them with less kindness, but preserve your own character, friendly and well disposed and propitious; and again do not go as if you were being torn away, but as for a man who has a quiet end the soul slips easily from its casing, so should your departure be from them. For it was Nature who bound you and united you to them, and now she sets you free. I am set free from men who are certainly my kinsfolk, yet I do not resist and I go under no compulsion. For this, too, is one of the things which are according to Nature.\n\n37. Accustom yourself in the case of whatever is done by any one, so far as possible to inquire within yourself: \u0027to what end does this man do this?\u0027 And begin with yourself and first examine yourself.\n\n38. Remember that what is hidden within you controls the strings; that is activity, that is life, that, if one may say so, is the man, Never occupy your imagination besides with the body which encloses you like a vessel and these organs which are moulded round you. They are like an axe, only differing as being attached to the body. For, indeed, these parts are of no more use without the cause which moves or checks them than the shuttle to the weaver, the pen to the writer or the whip to the man who holds the reins.",

      "text": "Okay, let\u0027s get Book X translated into \"Bro\" speak. Keep it punchy, keep it real.\n\n**MEDITATIONS BOOK X - THE BRO VERSION**\n\n1.  **Soul Check-In: Are You Ready to Be Real?** Yo, Soul! When are you gonna finally be good, simple, straightforward, totally transparent, clearer than the body wrapped around you? When will you actually *feel* loving and devoted? When will you be truly satisfied, needing nothing, craving nothing – no thing, no person, no pleasure hit? Not needing more time for fun, not needing the perfect location or weather or crowd? Will you just be cool with *now*, pleased with *this moment*, trusting that whatever the gods/universe sends is for you, is good, and is part of sustaining the whole perfect system – the good, just, beautiful reality that creates, supports, includes, and recycles everything? Will you finally just *be* the kind of being that can hang with gods and humans without constantly finding fault or being judged yourself?\n2.  **Know Your Needs (Body, Animal, Human):** First, figure out what your basic physical nature needs just to function. Do that, accept it, *unless* it makes your \u0027animal\u0027 nature worse (e.g., unhealthy addictions). Next, figure out what your \u0027animal\u0027 nature (instincts, drives) needs. Take that on board too, *unless* it makes your \u0027rational human\u0027 nature worse. Crucially, what\u0027s truly *rational* is also *social*. Use these rules, and stop stressing about everything else.\n3.  **Handle It or It Handles You:** Anything that happens, you can either naturally handle it or you can\u0027t. If you *can* handle it, don\u0027t bitch – just handle it, that\u0027s what your nature is for. If you *can\u0027t* naturally handle it, don\u0027t bitch either – because it\u0027ll take you out fast anyway. But remember this key trick: you can handle almost *anything* if your own judgment makes it tolerable by telling yourself, \"Doing this is beneficial\" or \"This is my duty.\" Frame it right.\n4.  **Correct Kindly or Check Yourself:** Someone screws up? Gently instruct them, point out what they missed. If that doesn\u0027t work, blame yourself (for expecting better, maybe?), or better yet, blame nobody. Just move on.\n5.  **It Was Always Coming:** Whatever happens to you was set up for you from the beginning of time. The chain of causes spinning since eternity included both your existence and *this specific event* happening to you. It\u0027s baked into the system.\n6.  **Atoms or Nature? Either Way, Be Part of the Team:** Whether it\u0027s random atoms or an ordered Nature, start with this: 1) I\u0027m part of the Whole, governed by Nature. 2) I\u0027m connected to other parts like me. Remember these? Then, as a part, you won\u0027t resent what the Whole assigns, because what helps the Whole can\u0027t hurt the part (the Whole doesn\u0027t harm itself, and no outside force *can* harm it).\n    *   **Flow Smoothly:** Because I remember I\u0027m part of this system and connected to others like me, I\u0027ll act socially, aim for the common good, and steer clear of anything that hurts the team. Do things this way, and life flows smoothly – just like a good citizen\u0027s life flows smoothly when they help fellow citizens and accept what the city assigns.\n7.  **\u0027Perishing\u0027 \u003d Changing (It\u0027s Not Bad for the Whole):** The parts of the Whole (everything in the Universe) must \"perish\" – which just means *change*. If this necessary change were actually *evil* for the parts, the Whole couldn\u0027t function properly. Did Nature *plan* to injure its own parts, design them to fail? Or did bad stuff just happen without its knowledge? Neither makes sense.\n    *   **Don\u0027t Whine About Natural Law:** Even if you ditch \"Nature\" and just talk \"natural laws,\" it\u0027s absurd to say parts change by natural law, then get shocked or mad when they *do*, especially when things just break down into their basic components. Atoms scatter, solids turn to earth, breath to air – it all gets reabsorbed by the universal Reason, whether through cosmic cycles or constant exchange.\n    *   **You Aren\u0027t Your Baby Body:** And don\u0027t think your current body and breath are the *exact* same ones you started with. You\u0027ve been taking in new material (food, air) constantly. What\u0027s changing is the stuff you *took in*. Even if this changing stuff feels intimately \"you,\" it doesn\u0027t wreck the core argument about change being natural.\n8.  **Earn Your Titles, Stay True:** Give yourself these titles: Good, Respectful, True, Sane (rational/attentive), Conforming (accepting fate), High-Minded (mind over body/fame/death). Guard them. If you lose them, get back to them fast.\n    *   **Definitions:** \u0027Sane\u0027 means paying close attention, not being sloppy. \u0027Conforming\u0027 means gladly accepting what Nature assigns. \u0027High-Minded\u0027 means your thinking part is above the body\u0027s ups and downs, petty reputation, death, and all that neutral stuff.\n    *   **Live the Titles or Bail:** Stick to these titles (not for others\u0027 praise, but for yourself), and you\u0027ll transform your life. Keep being torn and messed up like before? That\u0027s just animalistic, clinging to life like a wounded gladiator begging for one more day just to face the same claws tomorrow.\n    *   **Commit or Retreat:** Try hard for these titles. If you can hold them, great – live like you\u0027re on the Isles of the Blest. If you feel yourself slipping, retreat bravely to a quiet corner to regain control. Or, if needed, leave life altogether – not angrily, but simply, freely, with self-respect. Having made *that* exit right is at least one solid accomplishment.\n    *   **Remember the Gods (as Role Models):** Remembering the gods helps keep these titles in mind. They don\u0027t want flattery; they want rational beings to become like them. They want the fig tree to do fig-tree work, the dog dog work, the bee bee work, and the human *human* work.\n9.  **Life\u0027s Distractions vs. Real Practice:** Play-acting, pointless conflicts, hyper-excitement, lazy apathy – it\u0027s all just forms of slavery! Every day, your sacred principles get wiped out if you don\u0027t actively apply them. You need to look at every situation, every action, and simultaneously: 1) Get the practical task done. 2) Exercise your philosophical understanding. 3) Maintain that quiet confidence that comes from *knowing* things scientifically, without showing off. When will you just enjoy being simple? Being dignified? Knowing the true nature of things, their place, lifespan, composition, ownership, who gives and takes?\n10. **Predators, Big and Small:** A spider feels proud catching a fly. A guy feels proud trapping a rabbit, catching a tiny fish, hunting boars or bears, or taking Sarmatian prisoners. Examine their mindset – aren\u0027t they all just bandits on different scales? (Critique of pride in external \u0027conquests\u0027).\n11. **Master the Science of Change:** Get a methodical grip on how *everything* changes into everything else. Constantly focus on this aspect of Nature, practice thinking about it. Nothing elevates the mind more. Someone who gets this has already shed their attachment to the body. Realizing they\u0027ll soon leave everything and everyone behind, they dedicate themselves completely: to justice in their *own* actions, and to accepting Universal Nature in everything else. They stop caring what others say, think, or do against them. Content with two things: acting justly *now*, and embracing what\u0027s assigned *now*. They ditch all distractions and ambitions, wanting only to follow the straight path of law, following God/Nature\u0027s lead.\n12. **Act on Reason, or Get Advice:** Why wait for a hint when you can *see* what needs doing? If you see it, just do it kindly, without looking back. If you *don\u0027t* see it clearly, pause. Get advice from the best people available. If other issues block *that*, move forward cautiously with the opportunities you *do* have, sticking firmly to what seems just. Achieving justice is the best outcome; failure means failing at *that*. Follow Reason in everything, and you\u0027ll be efficient, quick, cheerful, and composed all at once.\n13. **Whose Opinion Matters at 3 AM?:** Ask yourself the second you wake up: Does it really matter if someone else blames my just and right actions? Hell no. Have you forgotten what these people who puff themselves up over praise or blame are *really* like? Their habits, what they chase, avoid, how they steal and scheme (not with hands, but with their minds – that precious part where faith, respect, truth, law, and goodness *could* live, if they chose)?\n14. **Give and Take with Nature:** To Nature, the giver and taker of all things, the educated and self-respecting person says: \"Give what you please, take back what you please.\" They say this not arrogantly, but simply listening to her, being in sync with her.\n15. **Live True, Even if Alone:** This little bit of life left? Live it like you\u0027re on a mountaintop. Where you are physically doesn\u0027t matter if you live *in the Universe* as your true city. Let people see a *real* person, living in tune with Nature. If they can\u0027t handle it? Let them kill you. Better that than living on *their* compromised terms.\n16. **Stop Talking, Start Being:** Don\u0027t just endlessly discuss what a good person is like. *Be* one.\n17. **Cosmic Scale Check:** Constantly picture the whole of Time and the whole of Substance. Realize that individual things are like a fig-seed compared to Substance, and a single moment is like one turn of a drill compared to Time. Keep perspective.\n18. **Everything is Dissolving Now:** Focus on anything that exists and reflect: it\u0027s *already* breaking down, changing, decaying, scattering. In a sense, it\u0027s \"born to die.\" See the process happening.\n19. **The Animal Cycle \u0026 Petty Rule:** Look at them: eating, sleeping, screwing, shitting. Basic animal stuff. Then look at them as rulers: bossy, angry, finding fault constantly. Yet yesterday they were slaves to so many desires and masters! And tomorrow they\u0027ll be back in some similar state. Humans!\n20. **Nature\u0027s Gifts Are Timely:** What benefits each person is what Universal Nature brings them, and it\u0027s beneficial *precisely when* she brings it. Trust the timing.\n21. **Loving What Happens:** \"Earth loves the rain,\" \"the sky loves to rain.\" The Universe itself *loves* to create what\u0027s next. So, I say to the Universe: \"I love what you love.\" Isn\u0027t that what \"This loves to happen\" really means? Align your will with reality.\n22. **Your Options: Live, Leave, or Die:** You either: 1) Keep living here, familiar with the game. 2) Choose to leave (suicide, though implied gently). 3) Die naturally, your service complete. Those are the only options. So, have courage.\n23. **Retreat is Anywhere (It\u0027s Internal):** Always remember Plato\u0027s point: any place of retreat is like any other. What matters is your inner state. Being on a mountaintop, by the sea, or stuck in the city – it\u0027s all the same if your mind is right. You can build your mental \u0027sheepfold on a hill\u0027 anywhere.\n24. **Mind Check: Healthy or Compromised?:** What is my core self (governing reason) doing *for me* right now? What am I making it into? What am I using it for? Is it lacking reason? Is it cut off from society? Is it so blended with the body\u0027s urges that it just follows them blindly?\n25. **Fugitive Slaves (Against Law/Nature):** Running from your master makes you a fugitive slave. Law/Nature is the ultimate master. Break its rules? Fugitive. Give in to sorrow, anger, fear? You\u0027re wishing things weren\u0027t as they were ordained by the master planner (Law/Nature). That\u0027s being a fugitive from reality.\n26. **Hidden Power of Creation \u0026 Growth:** A man plants a seed, walks away. Another causal principle takes over, works on it, completes a baby. Amazing result from a tiny start! Then the baby eats, another principle takes over, creates senses, impulses, life, strength – so many marvels! Contemplate these hidden processes. See the power, like gravity – invisible but undeniable.\n27. **Same Plays, Different Actors:** Constantly reflect how things happening today are just like things that happened long ago, and they\u0027ll happen again. Picture whole dramas, scenes you know from your life or history: Hadrian\u0027s court, Antoninus\u0027s court, Philip, Alexander, Croesus – all the same basic human stories, just with different actors.\n28. **Don\u0027t Be the Squealing Pig:** Picture anyone giving in to pain or discontent as like a pig being sacrificed – kicking and squealing. Or like someone groaning alone on their sickbed. Remember the chain of necessity we\u0027re bound by. Only rational creatures get the *choice* to follow willingly. Everyone else just gets dragged along. Choose willing obedience.\n29. **Death Check on Actions:** With each separate action, stop and ask: \"Is death scary because it means I\u0027m deprived of *this specific thing*?\" (Usually puts things in perspective).\n30. **See Your Own Similar Flaws:** When you bump into someone\u0027s bad behavior, immediately reflect: \"What similar mistake do *I* make?\" (e.g., treating money, pleasure, or fame as ultimate goods). Attend to this, and your anger will fade fast, especially when you realize they are likely *compelled* by their flawed judgments (what else *can* they do?). Or, if possible, remove the compulsion (teach them).\n31. **See Parallels, Realize Impermanence:** When you see certain types of people (Satyrion, Eutyches, etc.), picture their philosophical counterparts (Socrates, etc.). Look at yourself, picture a Caesar (or equivalent leader). Find parallels everywhere. Then let it hit you: \"Where are they *all* now?\" Nowhere, or unknown. This shows how human life is smoke, nothingness, especially since things change and won\u0027t exist again in infinite time. So why bother getting worked up? Why not just pass through this brief moment well-ordered? What situation are you really running from? Life is just an exercise school for reason. Wait patiently until you can digest *everything* like a strong stomach handles food, or a bright fire turns everything into flame and light.\n32. **Be Simple \u0026 Good, Or Don\u0027t Bother:** Let nobody truthfully say you aren\u0027t simple and good. Let anyone who thinks otherwise be a liar. This is entirely up to *you*. Who\u0027s stopping you from being good and simple? Just decide you won\u0027t keep living if you *can\u0027t* be that way. Reason itself rejects anything less.\n33. **Reason Can Go Anywhere:** What\u0027s the soundest thing to do or say in *this* situation? Whatever it is, you *can* do or say it. Don\u0027t make excuses about being prevented. You\u0027ll groan forever unless you feel that acting according to human nature, in *any* situation, is its own kind of \u0027luxury\u0027 (like pleasure is to the sensualist). Doing what aligns with your nature *is* indulgence. You can do it anywhere. A physical cylinder can\u0027t always roll; water, fire, etc., face obstacles. But Mind and Reason? They can move through *any* opposition, as their nature and will dictates. See how easily Reason can navigate (like fire goes up, stones down, cylinders roll downhill)? Ask for nothing more. Other obstacles affect the body (which is lifeless without mind) or don\u0027t harm the core self without Reason\u0027s consent.\n    *   **Obstacles Make You Better (If Used Right):** If obstacles *did* harm the core self, the person affected would become evil. But look – with other things, damage makes them worse. With humans using Reason? We can become *better*, more praiseworthy, by *using* circumstances correctly. Remember: nothing harms the citizen that doesn\u0027t harm the city (the social good), and nothing harms the city that doesn\u0027t harm the law (the rational order). None of these \u0027bad luck\u0027 events harm the law. Therefore, they don\u0027t harm the city or the citizen (in their core self).\n34. **Reminders Against Fear (Like Leaves):** For someone bitten by true principles, even the shortest, most common saying is enough to banish grief and fear. Like Homer\u0027s line: \"Leaves, the wind scatters some... like them are the children of men.\" Yes, your kids are \u0027leaves.\u0027 Those shouting praise or blame are \u0027leaves.\u0027 Those who remember you later are \u0027leaves.\u0027 They all sprout in spring, wind blows them down, the forest grows new ones. Brief life is everyone\u0027s lot. Yet you chase and avoid things like they\u0027re forever. Soon, you\u0027ll close your eyes. And soon after, someone else will be mourning the person who carried *you* out.\n35. **Healthy Mind Accepts All Input:** A healthy eye sees everything, doesn\u0027t wish everything were green (like someone with jaundice). Healthy ears/nose take in all sounds/smells. A healthy stomach handles all food (like a mill grinds anything). So, a healthy *understanding* must be ready for *all circumstances*. The mind that says, \"Keep my kids safe!\" or \"Everyone praise me!\" is like the sick eye wanting only green, or weak teeth wanting only soft food. It\u0027s demanding reality conform to its preference.\n36. **Nobody Dies Without Someone Glad (So Leave Kindly):** Nobody\u0027s so lucky that *everyone* is sad when they die. Someone\u0027s usually thinking, \"Good riddance.\" Even for a good, wise person, someone might think, \"Finally, we can relax without this teacher judging us silently.\" That\u0027s for the *good* ones! For the rest of us? Lots of reasons people might be glad we\u0027re gone. Think about this when you die, and you\u0027ll leave more easily: \"I\u0027m leaving a life where even the people I worked for, prayed for, thought about – even *they* want me gone, hoping for some relief.\" Why cling to staying longer? *But*, don\u0027t leave them unkindly because of this. Keep your character: friendly, well-disposed, forgiving. And don\u0027t go like you\u0027re being ripped away. Like a soul slipping easily from a body in a peaceful death, let your departure from them be smooth. Nature bound you to them; now she releases you. I\u0027m freed from my kin, but I don\u0027t resist, I\u0027m not forced. This release is also according to Nature.\n37. **Ask \"Why?\" (Start with Yourself):** Whenever someone does something, as much as possible, ask yourself: \"What\u0027s their underlying motive? What goal are they aiming for with this?\" And start this inquiry with *yourself*. Examine your own motives first.\n38. **You Are the Puppeteer Within:** Remember, the hidden thing inside you pulls the strings. *That* is the activity, the life, the *person*, so to speak. Don\u0027t get fixated on the body-vessel around you or the attached organs. They\u0027re just tools, like an axe, only attached. They\u0027re useless without the inner cause that moves or stops them – like a shuttle without a weaver, pen without a writer, whip without a driver.",

      "text": "BOOK XI\n\n1. The properties of the rational soul: it is conscious of itself, it moulds itself, makes of itself whatever it will, the fruit which it bears it gathers itself (whereas others gather the fruits of the field and what in animals corresponds to fruit), it achieves its proper end, wherever the close of life comes upon it; if any interruption occur, its whole action is not rendered incomplete as is the case in the dance or a play and similar arts, but in every scene of life and wherever it may be overtaken, it makes what it proposed to itself complete and entire, so that it can say: \u0027I have what is my own.\u0027\n\nMoreover, it goes over the whole Universe and the surrounding void and surveys its shape, reaches out into the boundless extent of time, embraces and ponders the periodic rebirth of the Whole and understands that those who come after us will behold nothing new nor did those who came before us behold anything greater, but in a way the man of forty years, if he have any understanding at all, has seen all that has been and that will be by reason of its uniformity. A property, too, of the rational soul is love of one\u0027s neighbour, truth, self-reverence and to honour nothing more than itself; and this last is a property of law also; accordingly right principle and the principle of justice differ not at all.\n\n2. You will despise joyous song and the dance and the combat-at-arms if you disintegrate the tuneful phrase into every one of its notes, and ask yourself about each whether you are its servant; for you will be ashamed. And so you will be if you do what corresponds in the case of the dance in respect of each movement or pose, and the same also in the case of the combat-at-arms. Generally then, excepting virtue and its effects, remember to have recourse to the several parts and by analysis to go on to despise them, and to apply the same process to life as a whole.\n\n3. How admirable is the soul which is ready and resolved, if it must this moment be released from the body, to be either extinguished or scattered or to persist. This resolve, too, must arise from a specific decision, not out of sheer opposition like the Christians, but after reflection and with dignity, and so as to convince others, without histrionic display.\n\n4. Have I done a neighbourly act? I am thereby benefited. Let this always be ready to your mind, and nowhere desist.\n\n5. What is your art? To be good. But how is this done except by principles of thought, concerned both with Universal Nature and with man\u0027s individual constitution?\n\n6. First of all tragedies were put on the stage to remind you of what comes to pass and that it is Nature\u0027s law for things to happen like that, and that you are not to make what charmed you on the stage a heavy burden on the world\u0027s greater stage. For you see that those events are bound to have that ending and that even those endure them who have cried aloud: \u0027Alas! Alas! Cithaeron.\u0027 There are also valuable sayings in the dramatists; an especially famous one, for instance:\n\n\u0027Were the gods careless of my sons and me,\nYet there is reason here\u0027,\n\nand again:\n\n\u0027Man must not vent his passion on mere things\u0027,\n\nor:\n\n\u0027Life, like ripe corn, must to the sickle yield\u0027,\n\nand the many others of the same sort.\n\nAfter Tragedy was introduced the Old Comedy, which through its instructive frankness and its reminder by actual plainness of language to avoid vanity was not without profit, and this directness Diogenes also adopted with a somewhat similar object. After the Old, observe what the Middle Comedy was like and afterwards with what end the New Comedy was adopted, passing little by little into a love of technique based on imitation. It is recognized that there are profitable sayings of these authors also, but after all what was the object to which the whole aim of such poetry and drama looked?\n\n7. How vividly it strikes you that no other calling in life is so fitted for the practice of philosophy as this in which you now find yourself.\n\n8. A branch cut off from the bough it belonged to cannot but be cut off also from the whole tree. Similarly a man, if severed from a single man, has fallen away from society as a whole. Now in the case of a branch, it is cut off by another agency, whereas man by his own act divides himself from his neighbour, when he hates him and turns from him, yet he does not realize that at the same time he has severed himself from the whole Commonwealth. Only there is this singular gift of Zeus who brought society together, that we are enabled to join again with the man we belong to, and again to become complements of the Whole. Yet, if it is often repeated, the effect of such separation is to make what separates difficult to unite and to restore. Generally speaking, too, the branch which originally grew with the tree and shared its transpiration, by remaining with it, is different from the branch which is engrafted again after being cut off, whatever gardeners may say.\n\n\u0027Grow together with them but do not share their doctrines.\u0027\n\n9. Just as those who oppose you as you progress in agreement with right principle will not be able to divert you from sound conduct, so do not let them force you to abandon your kindness towards them; but be equally on your guard in both respects, in steady judgement and behaviour as well as in gentleness towards those who try to hinder you or are difficult in other ways. For to be hard upon them is a weakness just as much as to abandon your course and to give in, from fright; for both are equally deserters from their post, the man who is in a panic as well as the man who is alienated from his natural kinsman and friend.\n\n10. \u0027No Nature is inferior to Art\u0027, for the crafts imitate natural things. If then this be true, the Nature which is the most perfect of all natures and all inclusive would not fall short of technical inventiveness. Moreover, all crafts create the lower in the interests of the higher, wherefore the Universal Nature does the same. And so from her is the birth of Justice, and from Justice the rest of the virtues have their existence; for Justice will not be preserved if we are concerned for indifferent objects or are easily deceived by them or are liable to stumble or to change.\n\n11. The objects whose pursuit or avoidance disturbs your peace do not come to you, but in a measure you go to them. Let your judgement at all events about them be untroubled and they will remain unmoved, and you will be seen neither to pursue nor to avoid them.\n\n12. The sphere of the soul is true to its own form, when it is neither extended in any way nor contracted inwards; when it is neither scattered nor dies down, but is lighted by the light whereby it sees the truth of all things and the truth within itself.\n\n13. Will any man despise me? Let him see to it. But I will see to it that I may not be found doing or saying anything that deserves to be despised. Will he hate me? Let him see to it. But I will be kind and well-disposed to every man and ready to show him what is overlooked, not reproachfully nor as though I were displaying forbearance, but genuinely and generously like the famous Phocion, if he was not in fact pretending. For the inward parts ought to be like that, and a man ought to be seen by the gods to be neither disposed to indignation nor complaining. For what harm is there to you if you are yourself at the moment doing the thing which is appropriate to your nature and accepting what is at this moment in season for Universal Nature, as a human being intent upon the common benefit being somehow realized?\n\n14. They despise one another, yet they flatter one another; they want to get above one another and yet bow down to one another.\n\n15. How rotten and crafty is the man who says: \u0027I have made up my mind to deal plainly with you.\u0027 What are you about, my friend? This preface is not necessary. The intention will reveal itself, it ought to be graven on the forehead; the tone of voice should give that sound at once; the intention should shine out in the eyes at once, as the beloved at once reads the whole in the glances of lovers. The simple and good man ought to be entirely such, like the unsavoury man, that those who stand by detect him at once, whether he will or not, as soon as he comes near. But the affectation of simplicity is like a razor; nothing is uglier than the wolf\u0027s profession of friendship, avoid that above all. The good and simple and kind has these qualities in his eyes and they are not hidden.\n\n16. Live constantly the highest life. This power is in a man\u0027s soul, if he is indifferent to what is indifferent; and he will be so, if he regard every one of these indifferent objects as a whole and in its parts, remembering that none of them creates in us a conception about itself nor even comes to us, but they are motionless, and it is we who create judgements about them and so to speak inscribe them on ourselves; and yet we need not inscribe them and, if we do so unconsciously, we can wipe them off again at once. Remember, too, that attention to this kind of thing will last but a little while and, after that, life will have reached its close. And yet what difficulty do these things present? If they are what Nature wills, rejoice in them and you will find them easy: if they are not, look for what your own nature wills and hasten to this, even should it bring you no glory; for every man is pardoned if he seeks his own good.\n\n17. What the origin of each experience is and the material conditions of each; what it is changing into and what it will be like when it has changed, and that it will suffer no injury by the change.\n\n18. First, what is my position in regard to others and how we came into the world for one another; and, to put it in a different way, that I was born to protect them, as the ram protects his flock or the bull his herd. Then, going further back, proceed from the truth that, unless the Universe is mere atoms, it is Nature which administers the Whole and, granted this, the lower are in the interests of the higher, the higher for one another.\n\nSecondly, what creatures they are at board and in bed and so on, and above all what kind of compulsion they are under because of their opinions, and with what arrogance they do what they do.\n\nThirdly, that, if they do what is right, you ought not to complain, but if what is wrong, clearly they act involuntarily and in ignorance—for as every soul is unwilling to be deprived of the truth, so is it unwilling not to be related to every man according to his worth; at any rate they resent it, if they are spoken of as unjust, inconsiderate, overreaching, in a word as wrong-doers in regard to their neighbours.\n\nFourthly, that you yourself also often do wrong and are another such as they are, and that, even if you do abstain from some kinds of wrong action, at all events you have at least a proclivity to them, though cowardice or tenderness for your good name or some similar bad motive keeps you from offences like theirs.\n\nFifthly, that you are not even sure that they actually do wrong; for many actions are done to serve a given purpose and, generally, one must ascertain much before making a certainly correct decision upon a neighbour\u0027s conduct.\n\nSixthly, when you are highly indignant or actually suffering, that man\u0027s life is but a moment, and in a little we are one and all laid low in death.\n\nSeventhly, that it is not what they do that troubles us, for that lies in their own governing selves, but it is our judgements about them. Very well then, remove your judgement about the supposed hurt and make up your mind to dismiss it, and your anger is gone. How then will you remove it? By reflecting that what hurts you is not morally bad; for unless what is morally bad is alone hurtful, it follows of necessity that you also do much wrong and become a brigand and a shifty character.\n\nEighthly, how much more grievous are what fits of anger and the consequent sorrows bring than the actual things are which produce in us those angry fits and sorrows.\n\nNinthly, that gentleness is invincible, if it be genuine and not sneering or hypocritical. For what can the most insolent do to you, if you continue gentle to him, and, if opportunity allows, mildly admonish him and quietly show him a better way at the very moment when he attempts to do you injury: \u0027No, my child; we came into the world for other ends. It is not I that am harmed, but you are harmed, my child.\u0027 And point out with tact and on general grounds that this is so, that not even bees act like that nor the many creatures that are by nature gregarious. But you must not do it ironically or as if finding fault, but affectionately and not feeling the sting in your soul, nor as if you were lecturing him or desired some bystander to admire you, but even if others are present, just in the way you would address him if you were alone.\n\nRemember these nine brief prescriptions, taking them as a gift from the Muses, and begin at last to be a human being, while life remains. And be as much on your guard against flattering them as against being angry with them, for both faults are unsocial and tend to injury. And in your angry fits have the maxim ready that it is not passion that is manly, but that what is kind and gentle as it is more human so is it more manly, and that this is the character which has strength and sinews and fortitude, not that which is indignant and displeased; for as this is nearer to imperturbability so it is nearer to power; and as grief is a mark of weakness, so also is anger, for both have been wounded and have surrendered to the wound.\n\nAnd, if you will, receive a tenth gift from the leader of the nine Muses, to wit that it is madness to require bad men not to do wrong, for it is aiming at the impossible. Still, to permit them to be such to others and to require them not to do wrong to yourself is to be unfeeling and tyrannical.\n\n19. You are especially to guard unremittingly against four moods of the governing self, and to wipe them out whenever you detect them, using in each case the following remedies: this imagination is not necessary; this is a solvent of society; this which you are about to say is not from yourself, and not to speak from yourself you must consider to be most incongruous.\n\nThe fourth thing that will cause you to reproach yourself is that this ensues from your more divine part being overcome and yielding to the less honourable and mortal portion, the body and its gross pleasures.\n\n20. Your element of spirit and all the element of fire that is mingled in you, in spite of their natural upward tendency, nevertheless obey the ordering of the Whole and are held forcibly in the compounded body in this region of the earth. Once more, all the elements of earth and of water in you, in spite of their downward tendency, are nevertheless lifted up and keep to a position which is not natural to them. In this way then even the elements are obedient to the Whole and, when they are stationed at a given point, remain there by compulsion until once more the signal for their dissolution is made from the other world.\n\nIs it not then monstrous that only your mind-element should disobey and be dissatisfied with its station? Yet nothing is imposed upon it that does violence to it, only what is in accord with its own nature, and still it does not tolerate this, but is carried in a reverse direction. For movement towards acts of injustice and habitual vice, towards wrath and sorrow and fear, is nothing else but a movement of severance from Nature. Moreover, when the governing self is discontented with any circumstance, then, too, it deserts its proper station, for it is constituted for holiness and the service of God no less than for just dealing with man. For these relations belong in kind to good fellowship, or rather are even more to be reverenced than just dealings.\n\n21. \u0027He who has not one and the same aim in life is unable to remain one and the same through all his life.\u0027 The saying is incomplete unless you add what sort of aim it should be. For as the conception of all the variety of goods which the majority of men fancy in any way to be good is not the same, but only the conception of certain of the kinds of goods, namely the general goods, so the aim to be set before oneself must be the social aim, that is the aim of the Commonwealth. For he who directs every private impulse to this will make all his actions uniform and because of this will always be the same man.\n\n22. The mountain mouse and the town mouse, and the fright and scurry of the latter.\n\n23. Socrates used to call the opinions of the multitude like other things: \u0027Bogies\u0027, things to frighten children.\n\n24. The Spartans used to put seats for visitors at their entertainments in the shade, and to seat themselves wherever they found room.\n\n25. Socrates\u0027 message to Perdiccas to excuse a visit to his court: \u0027to avoid\u0027, he said, \u0027coming to a most unfortunate end, that is, to be treated handsomely and not to have the power to return it\u0027.\n\n26. The writings of the school of Epicurus lay down the injunction to remind oneself continually of one of those who practised virtue in the days gone by.\n\n27. The Pythagoreans say: Took up to the sky before morning breaks\u0027, to remind ourselves of beings who always in the same relations and in the same way accomplish their work, and of their order, purity, and nakedness; for a star has no veil.\n\n28. What a man Socrates was in his under garment only, when Xanthippe took his upper garment and went out; and what he said to the friends who were shocked and retired when they saw him in that dress.\n\n29. In writing and reciting you will not be a master before you have been a pupil. This is much more true of living.\n\n30. \u0027You are a slave by nature: reason is not your part.\u0027\n\n31. \u0027And my dear heart laughed within.\u0027\n\n32. \u0027Virtue they will reproach, mocking her with harsh words.\u0027\n\n33. Only a madman expects a fig in winter; such is he who expects a child when it is no longer permitted.\n\n34. Epictetus used to say that, as you kissed your child, you should say in your heart: \u0027to-morrow maybe you will die\u0027. \u0027Those are words of ill omen.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 he replied, \u0027nothing that means an act of Nature is of evil omen, or it would be a bad omen to say that the corn has been reaped.\u0027\n\n35. The unripe grape, the ripe bunch, the dried raisin, all are changes; not to nothing, but to what at this moment is nothing.\n\n36. \u0027There is no robber of the will,\u0027 as Epictetus says.\n\n37. He said too: \u0027you must find out an art of assent, and keep your attention fixed in the sphere of the impulses, that they may be controlled by reservation, be social, and in proportion to value; and you must wholly abstain from desire and employ aversion in regard to nothing that is not in our own control.\n\n38. \u0027So we are contending,\u0027 he said, \u0027for no ordinary prize, but for whether we are to be sane or insane.\u0027\n\n39. Socrates used to say: \u0027What do you want? To have souls of rational or irrational beings?\u0027 \u0027Rational.\u0027 \u0027What rational beings, sound or inferior?\u0027 \u0027Sound.\u0027 \u0027Why don\u0027t you seek them?\u0027 \u0027Because we have them.\u0027 \u0027Why then do you fight and disagree?\u0027",

      "text": "Alright, Book XI, let\u0027s give it the \"Bro\" treatment. Final stretch.\n\n**MEDITATIONS BOOK XI - THE BRO VERSION**\n\n1.  **The Rational Soul\u0027s Superpowers:** Your thinking soul has some cool properties: It knows itself. It shapes itself. It makes itself whatever it wants to be. It harvests its *own* fruit (its good actions and character), unlike plants or animals where someone else gets the benefit. It reaches its goal no matter when life ends – unlike a dance or play that\u0027s ruined if interrupted, the rational soul completes its intended work (living virtuously) in *every* moment, wherever it\u0027s stopped. It can always say, \"I possess what is truly mine (my integrity).\"\n    *   **Cosmic View \u0026 Human Connection:** Plus, it scans the whole Universe and the void beyond, figures out its shape, reaches across infinite time, understands the cycles of cosmic rebirth, and gets that future generations won\u0027t see anything fundamentally new, nor did past ones see anything grander. A reasonably smart 40-year-old has basically seen the whole repeating pattern. Also core to the rational soul: loving your neighbor, truth, self-respect, and valuing nothing higher than itself (its own rational nature) – which is exactly what Law aims for too. Right principle and justice? Same thing.\n2.  **Break It Down to Despise It (If It\u0027s Not Virtue):** You\u0027ll stop being impressed by fancy music, dancing, or skilled fighting if you break them down. Take the song: analyze each individual note. Ask yourself about *each note*, \"Am I a slave to *this*?\" You\u0027ll feel silly. Do the same for dance: analyze each movement, each pose. Same for fighting skills. Basically, for everything *except actual virtue and its results*, remember to dissect it into its parts. By analyzing the components, you\u0027ll come to see the whole thing as less impressive. Apply this same analytical breakdown to life as a whole.\n3.  **Ready for the Exit (The Right Way):** How awesome is a soul that\u0027s ready *right now*, if necessary, to leave the body – whether that means being extinguished, scattered, or just persisting elsewhere? But this readiness has to come from clear-headed judgment, not just stubborn defiance (like those early Christians showing off), but thoughtfully, with dignity, convincingly, without making a big dramatic show.\n4.  **Helping Others Helps You:** Did I do something neighborly? Cool, *I* benefit from that. Keep this thought always ready. Never stop acting this way.\n5.  **Your Craft? Being Good:** What\u0027s your profession, your art? To be a good person. How do you master that? Only through solid principles, understanding both Universal Nature and your own specific human constitution.\n6.  **Lessons from the Stage (Tragedy \u0026 Comedy):** Tragedies were first staged to remind you how things naturally happen, that it\u0027s Nature\u0027s law for stuff like that to occur. Don\u0027t let what entertained you on stage become a heavy burden when similar things happen on life\u0027s bigger stage. You see those tragic endings are inevitable, even for characters who cried out in despair (\"Alas, Cithaeron!\"). Dramatists offer valuable lines too: \"Even if the gods ignored me and mine, there\u0027s still reason.\" Or: \"Don\u0027t waste rage on mere things.\" Or: \"Life, like ripe corn, must be harvested.\" Lots like that.\n    *   **Comedy\u0027s Role:** After tragedy came Old Comedy – useful for its blunt honesty, using plain language to mock vanity. Diogenes used that directness too. Then Middle Comedy, then New Comedy, which got more focused on technical skill and imitation. These also have useful insights, sure, but what was the *overall point* of all that poetry and drama aiming at? (Implied: Often just entertainment, not deep truth).\n7.  **This Life IS Philosophy Practice:** How clearly you see it now: no other situation in life is *better* suited for practicing philosophy than the one you\u0027re in right this minute. (Embrace your current circumstances as the perfect training ground).\n8.  **Cut Off Branch, Cut Off Man:** A branch cut from its limb is obviously cut from the whole tree. Similarly, a person cut off from even one other person has fallen away from the whole community. Difference is, a branch is cut by something else; a person cuts *themselves* off through hatred and turning away. They don\u0027t realize they\u0027re also severing themselves from the entire commonwealth. But here\u0027s the cool gift from Zeus (who set up society): you *can* rejoin the person you belong with, become part of the Whole again. *However*, if you keep separating yourself, it gets harder to reunite and heal each time. Generally, the branch that grew with the tree is different from one cut off and grafted back on, no matter what gardeners say. (Stay connected, don\u0027t isolate yourself).\n    *   **The Motto:** \"Grow together with them, but don\u0027t share their [false] doctrines.\" (Maintain connection without compromising principles).\n9.  **Guard Both Steadfastness and Kindness:** Just like people opposing your rational progress can\u0027t force you off the path of right action, don\u0027t let them force you to abandon your *kindness* towards them either. Guard both equally: steady judgment and action, *and* gentleness towards those who hinder or annoy you. Getting harsh is weakness, just like giving up your principles out of fear is weakness. Both are deserting your post – the panicked guy and the one alienated from their natural kin.\n10. **Nature Outshines Art; Justice is Foundational:** No human craft (Art) is better than Nature, because crafts just imitate Nature. If that\u0027s true, then the most perfect, all-encompassing Nature certainly isn\u0027t less inventive than human tech. Plus, all crafts make lesser things serve higher ones; Universal Nature does the same. This is where Justice comes from, and all other virtues depend on it. You can\u0027t maintain Justice if you obsess over neutral things (externals), get easily fooled, stumble constantly, or keep changing your mind.\n11. **Problems Don\u0027t Come to You, You Go to Them:** Those things you chase or run from, the ones messing up your peace? They aren\u0027t actually coming *to* you. You\u0027re the one going *towards* them (mentally). Just keep your judgment about them calm and steady, and *they* will stay put (as neutral externals). Then you won\u0027t be seen chasing or avoiding them anymore.\n12. **The Soul\u0027s Perfect Shape:** The soul keeps its true form when it\u0027s not stretched out trying to grab things, nor contracted inwards in fear; when it\u0027s not scattered in chaos, nor collapsed in apathy, but shines with the light that lets it see the truth of all things, including the truth within itself.\n13. **Handling Contempt \u0026 Hate:** Someone despises me? Their problem. My job? Make sure *I\u0027m* not doing or saying anything deserving contempt. Someone hates me? Their problem too. My job? Be kind and well-disposed to everyone, ready to gently show them what they\u0027re missing – not scolding, not showing off my tolerance, but genuinely and generously (like Phocion, if he was sincere). Your inner self should be like that. The gods should see you as someone not prone to indignation or complaining. Because really, what harm is it *to you* if you\u0027re just doing what fits your nature right now, accepting what\u0027s timely for the Universe, acting as a human focused on the common good?\n14. **The Hypocrisy Game:** They look down on each other, yet they flatter each other. They want to climb over each other, yet they bow down to each other. Observe the absurdity.\n15. **Beware Fake Simplicity:** How rotten and sneaky is the person who says, \"Look, I\u0027m gonna be totally honest with you...\" Dude, what are you doing? No need for the preface! Your intention reveals itself. It should be written on your forehead, sound in your voice, shine in your eyes – instantly, like lovers read each other\u0027s glances. A truly simple and good person *is* just that way, like someone who stinks – you know it the second they walk in, whether they want you to or not. Faking simplicity? That\u0027s like a hidden knife (\"razor\"). Nothing\u0027s uglier than a wolf pretending friendship. Avoid that above all. Goodness, simplicity, kindness – you see it in their eyes; it can\u0027t be hidden.\n16. **Live the Highest Life (Indifference is Key):** The power to live the best life is always within you, *if* you\u0027re indifferent to indifferent things (externals). You\u0027ll be indifferent if you look at each external as a whole and in its parts, remembering: None of them create our opinion about them, nor do they come *to* us. They\u0027re just sitting there. *We* create judgments about them, basically writing them onto ourselves. We don\u0027t *have* to write them, and if we did unconsciously, we can erase them instantly. Remember too, focusing on this stuff only lasts a little while before life ends. So what\u0027s the big deal? If these externals align with Nature\u0027s will, enjoy them, they\u0027ll be easy. If not, figure out what your *own* nature wills and go for that, even if it brings no fame. Everyone\u0027s excused for seeking their own true good.\n17. **Quick Analysis Drill:** For any experience: What\u0027s its origin? What\u0027s it made of? What\u0027s it changing into? What will it be like after changing? Will the change cause it any real harm? (The answer is usually no).\n18. **Framework for Dealing with Others (The 9 Reminders Expanded):**\n    *   **First (Connection):** What\u0027s my relationship to others? We exist for each other. I was born to protect them, like a ram protects sheep or a bull the herd. Go deeper: Unless it\u0027s all random atoms, Nature runs the Whole. Lower things serve higher; higher things serve each other.\n    *   **Second (Their Reality):** What are these people really like (at meals, in bed, etc.)? What opinions *force* them to act as they do? How arrogant are they in their actions?\n    *   **Third (Involuntary Wrongdoing):** If they act rightly, no need to complain. If wrongly, they clearly do it unwillingly and out of ignorance. Just like nobody wants to be deprived of truth, nobody *wants* to fail at treating others appropriately. They resent being called unjust, inconsiderate, greedy – proof they know it\u0027s wrong.\n    *   **Fourth (Your Own Flaws):** You mess up often too; you\u0027re just like them. Even if you avoid *some* specific wrongs, you likely have the tendency, but maybe fear, reputation, or some other bad motive holds you back from acting like them.\n    *   **Fifth (You Don\u0027t Know the Whole Story):** You aren\u0027t even sure they *are* doing wrong. Many actions have hidden purposes. You need way more info before judging someone\u0027s actions correctly.\n    *   **Sixth (Life is Short):** When you\u0027re super mad or actually suffering, remember: human life is just a moment. Soon enough, we\u0027re all dead and buried.\n    *   **Seventh (It\u0027s Your Judgment):** It\u0027s not *their actions* that trouble you (those belong to their minds), it\u0027s *your judgments* about their actions. So, remove the judgment about the supposed \u0027harm,\u0027 decide to dismiss it, and your anger vanishes. How? By realizing that what \u0027hurts\u0027 you isn\u0027t morally bad. Unless only moral badness is truly harmful, then you must admit *you* also do much wrong and become a villain sometimes too!\n    *   **Eighth (Anger Hurts More):** The grief and trouble caused by fits of anger are usually way worse than the original things that triggered the anger.\n    *   **Ninth (Invincible Gentleness):** Genuine kindness (not sarcastic or fake) is unbeatable. What can the most insulting person do if you stay gentle, mildly correct them when possible, and calmly show them a better way *right when* they\u0027re trying to harm you? \"No, my child, we\u0027re here for better things. *I\u0027m* not the one being harmed here; *you* are harming yourself, my child.\" Point this out tactfully, generally – like explaining how bees or herd animals don\u0027t act that way. No irony, no lecturing, no playing to bystanders. Just genuine affection, even if alone with them.\n    *   **Tenth Gift (From the Muse Leader):** It\u0027s madness to expect bad people *not* to do wrong – that\u0027s demanding the impossible. But allowing them to be bad towards others while demanding they *never* wrong *you*? That\u0027s just being callous and tyrannical.\n19. **Four Bad Moods to Zap:** Watch out for these four toxic states of mind in your core self. Wipe them out instantly with these remedies:\n    *   *Useless Imagination:* \"This thought isn\u0027t necessary.\"\n    *   *Anti-Social Thought:* \"This destroys social cohesion.\"\n    *   *Inauthentic Speech:* \"This isn\u0027t coming from my true self\" (and speaking falsely is deeply wrong).\n    *   *Mind Losing to Body:* Recognize when your higher, divine part is being beaten by the lower, mortal body and its crude pleasures – this should cause self-reproach.\n20. **Even Elements Obey; Mind Shouldn\u0027t Rebel:** Your fiery, spiritual elements naturally tend upwards, yet they obey the cosmic order and stay contained in your body here on earth. Your earthy, watery elements naturally tend downwards, yet they\u0027re held up, not in their natural place. See? Even basic elements obey the Whole, staying put until signaled to dissolve. Isn\u0027t it monstrous, then, that only your *mind* element disobeys and hates its station? Especially when nothing forced on it violates its *own* nature! Yet it resists, gets carried the wrong way. Moving towards injustice, vice, anger, grief, fear – that\u0027s just severing yourself from Nature. When your core self resents any circumstance, it deserts its post. It was made for holiness and serving God/Reality, *and* for dealing justly with people. These social duties are part of good fellowship, maybe even more sacred than just dealings alone.\n21. **One Aim \u003d One Self (Make it Social):** \"Someone without one single life aim can\u0027t stay the same person throughout life.\" True, but incomplete. You need to add *what kind* of aim. Most people\u0027s ideas of \u0027good\u0027 vary wildly. But the concept of *common* goods, social goods – that\u0027s more stable. So, your life aim must be social, focused on the Commonwealth (the common good). Direct every personal impulse towards *that*, and your actions become uniform, making *you* consistently the same person.\n22. **Town Mouse vs. Country Mouse:** (A reminder of Aesop\u0027s fable – the town mouse\u0027s fear and chaos vs. the country mouse\u0027s simplicity). Choose simplicity.\n23. **Opinions as Bogeymen:** Socrates called popular opinions \"Bogies\" – things used to frighten children. Don\u0027t be scared by them.\n24. **Spartan Humility:** At parties, Spartans put visitors in the shady seats (prime spots) and took whatever seats were left for themselves. (Humility, prioritizing others).\n25. **Socrates Declining a King\u0027s Invite:** Socrates told King Perdiccas he wouldn\u0027t visit because he wanted to avoid the worst fate: being treated incredibly well (receiving lavish gifts/favors) and being unable to return the favor adequately. (Maintaining independence, avoiding obligation).\n26. **Epicurean Reminder:** The Epicureans advised continually remembering one of the past heroes who practiced virtue. (Use role models).\n27. **Pythagorean Morning Sky:** The Pythagoreans said: \"Look up at the sky before dawn.\" Why? To remind ourselves of the celestial bodies that always do their work consistently, in order, pure, and unadorned (stars need no veil). (Find inspiration in cosmic order and consistency).\n28. **Socrates in His Undershirt:** Remember Socrates wearing just his undershirt after Xanthippe took his outer robe? And what he said to his embarrassed friends who saw him like that? (Indifference to external appearances, maintaining composure).\n29. **Pupil Before Master (Especially in Life):** You can\u0027t be a master writer or speaker until you\u0027ve first been a student. This applies even *more* strongly to the art of living.\n30. **Slave to Passion:** \"You\u0027re basically a slave; reason isn\u0027t your guide.\" (If you\u0027re ruled by irrational impulses).\n31. **Inner Joy:** \"And my dear heart laughed within.\" (Finding internal contentment regardless of externals).\n32. **Virtue Gets Mocked:** \"They will insult Virtue, mocking her with harsh words.\" (Expect criticism when you try to live rightly).\n33. **Winter Figs (Expecting the Impossible):** Only a madman expects figs in winter. Same for someone expecting a child when it\u0027s biologically impossible (or wishing for things clearly against nature/timing).\n34. **Epictetus: Kissing Your Child:** Epictetus said when kissing your child, whisper internally: \"Tomorrow, maybe you\u0027ll die.\" Friends said, \"That\u0027s bad luck!\" He replied, \"No, anything signifying a natural event isn\u0027t bad luck. Is it bad luck to say the corn has been harvested?\" (Accepting mortality and natural cycles).\n35. **Grape Changes (Not to Nothing):** Unripe grape, ripe bunch, raisin – all are just *changes*. Not into non-existence, but into something that isn\u0027t *presently* the previous form. (Change is transformation, not annihilation).\n36. **Can\u0027t Rob the Will:** \"Nobody can rob you of your free will,\" as Epictetus says. (Your choices are ultimately yours).\n37. **Epictetus on Assent \u0026 Impulse Control:** He also said: \"Develop skill in giving assent (agreeing only with true impressions). Pay close attention to your impulses – make sure they have a \u0027reservation clause\u0027 (acknowledging externals aren\u0027t guaranteed), are social, and match the thing\u0027s true value. Completely abstain from desire (for externals). Use aversion only for things truly within your control (your own bad judgments/actions).\"\n38. **The Real Contest (Sanity):** \"So,\" Epictetus said, \"we aren\u0027t fighting for some trivial prize, but for whether we remain sane or go insane.\"\n39. **Socrates: Why Fight if You Have Reason?:** Socrates asked: \"What do you want? Souls of rational beings or irrational ones?\" \"Rational.\" \"What kind – sound or flawed?\" \"Sound.\" \"So why aren\u0027t you seeking them?\" \"Because we *have* them.\" \"Then why are you fighting and disagreeing all the time?\" (Use the reason you possess!).",

      "text": "Here\u0027s a thinking process for generating the LaTeX output:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants the \"Bro Version\" translations of Marcus Aurelius\u0027 Meditations, specifically Books VI through X, formatted as LaTeX. Book XI should be excluded.\n\n2.  **Identify the Source Texts:** I need the \"Bro Version\" translations I generated previously for Books VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X.\n\n3.  **Choose LaTeX Structure:**\n    *   A standard `article` class is suitable.\n    *   Need basic packages: `inputenc` (for UTF-8 usually), `fontenc`, maybe `geometry` for margins if needed (though default might be fine), `amsmath`, `amsfonts`, `amssymb` are good practice for philosophy/math-like text, though not strictly required here. `hyperref` is good for potential future linking. `parskip` or similar might be nice for paragraph spacing, fitting the \"bro\" style\u0027s paragraph breaks.\n    *   Use standard sectioning commands: `\\documentclass`, `\\usepackage`, `\\title`, `\\author`, `\\date`, `\\maketitle`, `\\section*` (or `\\chapter*` if using `book` class, but `article` seems simpler), `\\subsection*` (or maybe just bold paragraphs).\n    *   Since the original text has numbered sections within each book, I should replicate that numbering. An `enumerate` environment within each \"Book\" section seems appropriate. Using `\\item` for each numbered point.\n\n4.  **LaTeX Formatting Details:**\n    *   **Title:** \"The Meditations: Bro Version (Books VI-X)\" or similar.\n    *   **Author:** \"Marcus Aurelius (as interpreted by \u0027Bro\u0027)\" or just leave it implicit. Let\u0027s keep it simple.\n    *   **Date:** Can use `\\today` or omit.\n    *   **Book Headings:** Use `\\section*{BOOK VI: THE UNIVERSE \u0026 YOUR PLACE IN IT}` (using the titles I created for the bro version). Using `*` prevents them from being numbered automatically, which is good since the internal points *are* numbered.\n    *   **Numbered Points:** Start an `enumerate` environment for each book. Each point from the \"Bro Version\" becomes an `\\item`.\n    *   **Paragraph Breaks:** The \"Bro Version\" uses paragraph breaks within some points. In LaTeX, a blank line creates a paragraph break. This should translate well.\n    *   **Emphasis:** The \"Bro Version\" uses italics and bolding. Use `\\textit{...}` for italics and `\\textbf{...}` for bold.\n    *   **Special Characters:** Ensure any special characters (like apostrophes, quotes) are handled correctly by LaTeX. Standard apostrophes and double quotes usually work fine with `inputenc[utf8]`.\n    *   **Parenthetical Notes:** Keep them as parentheses `(...)`.\n    *   **Quotes within Text:** Use LaTeX quoting conventions (` ``...\u0027\u0027 `) if needed, though standard double quotes `\"` often render okay too. Let\u0027s stick to standard `\"` for simplicity unless rendering issues appear.\n\n5.  **Pre-computation/Pre-analysis (Mental Walkthrough):**\n    *   **Book VI:** Title is \"THE UNIVERSE \u0026 YOUR PLACE IN IT\". Has 59 points. Needs `enumerate`. Check for italics/bolding. Point 13 has italics and parentheses. Point 14 has quotes. Point 16 has bold hint and quotes. Point 30 has italics and quotes. Point 42 mentions Chrysippus. Point 50 has italics. Point 51 has italics. Point 57 has italics.\n    *   **Book VII:** Title is \"MEDITATIONS BOOK VII - THE BRO VERSION\". Has 74 points. Needs `enumerate`. Check formatting. Point 13 uses italics. Point 14 uses italics. Point 15 uses italics. Point 22 uses italics. Point 23 uses italics. Point 35 quotes Plato (use italics or quotes). Points 36-46 are quotes (use nested quotes or italics). Point 48 uses italics. Point 51 uses italics.\n    *   **Book VIII:** Title is \"MEDITATIONS BOOK VIII - THE BRO VERSION\". Has 61 points. Needs `enumerate`. Check formatting. Point 8 has bold text. Point 16 uses italics. Point 24 uses italics. Point 25 uses italics. Point 33 uses italics. Point 34 uses italics. Point 36 uses italics. Point 40 uses italics. Point 41 quotes Epicurus. Point 47 uses italics. Point 48 uses italics. Point 57 uses italics.\n    *   **Book IX:** Title is \"MEDITATIONS BOOK IX - THE BRO VERSION\". Has 43 points (Note: The original had 43, the bro version text I generated correctly follows this). Needs `enumerate`. Check formatting. Point 1 has subsections with bolding/italics. Point 3 has italics. Point 8 has italics and quotes. Point 10 has italics. Point 24 has quotes. Point 27 uses italics. Point 29 uses italics. Point 31 uses italics. Point 33 uses italics. Point 35 uses italics. Point 39 uses italics. Point 40 uses italics. Point 41 quotes Epicurus. Point 42 uses italics.\n    *   **Book X:** Title is \"MEDITATIONS BOOK X - THE BRO VERSION\". Has 39 points. Needs `enumerate`. Check formatting. Point 3 uses italics. Point 7 uses quotes and italics. Point 8 has quotes and italics. Point 18 has numbered sub-points (use nested `enumerate` or just formatting). Point 21 uses quotes and italics. Point 23 quotes Plato. Point 25 uses italics. Point 31 quotes Socrates. Point 33 uses italics. Point 34 quotes Epictetus. Point 35 uses italics. Point 36 quotes Epictetus. Point 37 quotes Epictetus. Point 38 quotes Epictetus. Point 39 quotes Socrates.\n\n6.  **Drafting the LaTeX Code (Iterative Process):**\n    *   Start with the preamble (`\\documentclass`, `\\usepackage`, `\\title`, etc.).\n    *   Create the `\\maketitle` command.\n    *   Add `\\section*{BOOK VI...}`.\n    *   Start `\\begin{enumerate}`.\n    *   Copy and paste the text for Book VI, point 1, wrap it in `\\item`, and add any `\\textit` or `\\textbf`.\n    *   Repeat for all points in Book VI.\n    *   End `\\end{enumerate}`.\n    *   Add `\\section*{BOOK VII...}`.\n    *   Start `\\begin{enumerate}`.\n    *   Copy/paste/format Book VII points.\n    *   End `\\end{enumerate}`.\n    *   Repeat for Books VIII, IX, and X.\n    *   Add `\\end{document}`.\n\n7.  **Refinement and Review:**\n    *   Read through the generated LaTeX code. Check for syntax errors (missing braces, incorrect command names).\n    *   Ensure consistent formatting (e.g., all book titles are `\\section*`).\n    *   Verify that all italics/bolding from the source text have been correctly translated to LaTeX commands.\n    *   Check numbering structure (each book uses `enumerate`, nested points handled okay).\n    *   Make sure quotes are handled reasonably (using `` and \u0027\u0027 might be slightly better style, but standard `\"` is okay for this informal text). Let\u0027s stick with `\"` for ease of copy/paste, but note the alternative.\n    *   Ensure paragraph breaks within items are preserved by blank lines in the LaTeX source.\n    *   Double-check that Book XI is indeed *excluded*.\n\n8.  **Final Output Generation:** Present the complete LaTeX code block.",

Seriously, even the act of dying is just another part of life. So just handle \\textit{this moment} right. That’s plenty.\n\n\\item \\textbf{See What It \\textit{Really} Is:} Look deeper. Don\u0027t let the real substance or the actual value of anything slip past you. See things for what they truly are, under the surface hype.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Everything\u0027s Changing, Fast:} All this stuff around you? It’s gonna vanish quicker than you think. Maybe it all turns back into basic energy soup, maybe it breaks down into atoms. Point is, it\u0027s temporary. Don\u0027t cling.\n\n\\item \\textbf{The System Knows Its Business:} That intelligence running the universe? It knows its own setup, what it creates, and the stuff it\u0027s working with. It’s got a handle on things.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Best Revenge? Don\u0027t Be Like Them:} Want the ultimate payback against someone who wronged you? Simple: Don\u0027t become an asshole just like them.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Find Your Flow in Helping Others:} Your real peace and purpose? Find it in doing one good, helpful action after another, staying connected to the bigger picture (the \u0027God\u0027 principle, the natural order, whatever you call it).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Your Mind Calls the Shots:} Your own mind – your control center – is what wakes itself up, adapts, makes itself into what it wants to be, and frames \\textit{everything} that happens to you exactly how it chooses to see it. You control the internal narrative.\n\n\\item \\textbf{It All Fits the Master Plan:} Everything unfolds according to the rules of the whole system. It’s not dictated by some rogue outside force or some random internal glitch. It’s all part of the one big flow.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Chaos or Order? Either Way, Act Right:} So, is the universe just a random jumble, atoms crashing and scattering? Or is there unity, order, maybe even a plan (Providence)? If it’s just chaos, why freak out? Why care about anything besides eventually turning back to dust? The scattering happens no matter what. But if there \\textit{is} order? Then chill out, trust the process, and find courage in the system. Either way, your job is to act rationally \\textit{now}.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Snap Back to Center:} When life inevitably throws you off balance and rattles your cage, get back to your core self – fast. Don\u0027t stay out of sync longer than needed. You regain control by constantly returning to that inner balance point.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Philosophy is Home Base:} Think of the daily grind, the demands of the world (\u0027the palace\u0027) like a step-mom you gotta deal with. Your philosophy, your principles? That’s your actual Mom, your home base. Keep going back there, recharge there. That’s what makes the daily grind tolerable, and makes \\textit{you} tolerable \\textit{in} it.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Strip Away the Hype:} Practice seeing fancy stuff for what it \\textit{really} is. That gourmet meal? Dead fish, dead bird, dead pig. That expensive wine? Fermented grape juice. That designer label? Sheep wool dyed with bug juice. Sex? Friction and messy biology. See the raw facts. Strip away the fancy labels and status games. Ego is a total bullshit artist – just when you think you’re being important and profound, you’re probably just buying into hype. (Like Crates said about that Xenocrates dude – even smart guys get fooled).\n\n\\item \\textbf{What \\textit{Real} People Admire:} Most folks admire basic stuff: possessions (rocks, wood), things that grow (figs, vines). Slightly more advanced folks admire things with \u0027life force\u0027: herds, power over slaves. Smarter still admire technical skill, being good \\textit{at} something. But the person who truly values Reason – rational, social intelligence? They stop caring about that other crap. They focus on keeping their \\textit{own} mind rational and contributing positively, working with others toward that goal.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Life\u0027s a Flow, Don\u0027t Cling:} Some things are just starting, others are ending, some are already gone while forming. Constant change keeps the world fresh, like time itself always moving. In this rushing river of existence, what specific thing flowing by is worth obsessing over? It’s like falling for a sparrow that flies past and is gone instantly. Your own life is just as fleeting – like breathing in, breathing out. You got this breath at birth, you give it back eventually. That\u0027s the whole cycle.\n\n\\item \\textbf{What\u0027s Actually Valuable? (Hint: Not Clapping):} Just breathing like an animal, reacting to senses, following urges, herding together, eating and shitting – that\u0027s not valuable. Getting applause? Likes? Empty praise? Nope, ditch that fake glory. So what \\textit{is} valuable? Acting purposefully, according to your rational human design. Like a craftsman makes something fit for its purpose, your purpose is to act rightly. That’s what real growth is about. Get that right, and you won\u0027t desperately need the other stuff. You’ll ditch envy, suspicion, scheming. Respecting your \\textit{own} mind, your reason – that makes you solid, connects you with others, and aligns you with reality (the gods).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Virtue Moves Differently:} Physical stuff moves predictably – up, down, circles. But human excellence, virtue? It moves on a higher level, a path that’s harder to map but ultimately gets you where you need to go.\n\n\\item \\textbf{The Absurdity of Posthumous Fame:} Isn\u0027t it weird how people trash-talk those around them now, but crave praise from people born later whom they\u0027ll never meet? That’s as logical as being sad that cavemen didn’t compliment your outfit. Pointless.\n\n\\item \\textbf{If It\u0027s Possible, It\u0027s Possible for You:} Don\u0027t assume something is impossible \\textit{for you} just because it feels hard right now. If it\u0027s something humans \\textit{can} generally do, and it\u0027s appropriate, then consider it within your reach too. Don’t write yourself off.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Treat Life\u0027s Fouls Like Sports Fouls:} In a game, someone might accidentally scratch you or bump you hard. You don\u0027t hold a lifelong grudge, right? You don\u0027t assume they\u0027re evil. Maybe you just keep a bit of distance, but good-naturedly. Do that in life. Overlook minor stuff from people who are basically your \u0027opponents\u0027 in the daily grind. You can avoid them without hating or suspecting them.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Be Glad to Be Proven Wrong:} If someone can logically show you that you’ve made a mistake in thought or action, be \\textit{glad} to change. You\u0027re after the truth, right? Truth never hurt anyone. Staying stuck in your own bullshit and ignorance? \\textit{That\u0027s} what hurts.\n\n\\item \\textbf{My Job is My Focus:} Let me just do my duty. Everything else is noise. It’s either lifeless stuff, an irrational animal, or someone who’s lost and doesn’t know the way.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Handle Everything Appropriately:} Use animals and objects rationally and fairly – you have reason, they don\u0027t. Treat other people decently, as fellow rational beings. And always keep the big picture principles in mind (call on the gods). Don\u0027t sweat how long you do this – even three hours lived right is solid.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Death: The Great Equalizer:} Alexander the Great and his stable boy? Ended up exactly the same after death. Either reabsorbed into the universe or scattered into atoms. Same destination.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Zoom Out: See the Simultaneous Action:} Think about all the stuff happening in your body and mind \\textit{right now}, all at once. Now scale that up. You won\u0027t be shocked that countless things are happening simultaneously across the whole universe, all part of one unified system.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Break It Down, Stay Calm:} If someone asks you how to spell \u0027Antoninus\u0027, you don\u0027t yell. You calmly list the letters: A-N-T-O... Do the same with your duties. They have steps. Know the steps, stick to them calmly. If people push back or get difficult, don\u0027t get sucked into their drama. Just methodically finish what you set out to do.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Teach, Don\u0027t Just Rage:} It’s wrong to stop people from going after what \\textit{they think} is good for them. When you just get pissed off because they screw up, you\u0027re kinda doing that. They\u0027re acting based on \\textit{their} flawed view of what\u0027s beneficial. Okay, so they\u0027re wrong? Fine. \\textit{Teach them}. Show them the better way. Don\u0027t just stand there indignant.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Death is Just Hitting Pause:} Death means rest – from constant sensory input, from being jerked around by impulses, from overthinking everything, and from the body’s endless demands.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Mind Over Body, Always:} It\u0027s pathetic if your mind gives up before your body does. Your body can endure a lot; don\u0027t let your spirit be the first to tap out.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Be Good, Not Caesar; Follow the Role Model (Antoninus):} Watch out you don\u0027t get corrupted by power or status – don\u0027t become a \u0027Caesar,\u0027 get \u0027dipped in purple.\u0027 Keep it real: simple, good, straight-up, serious, fair, respectful of the bigger picture, kind, solid, strong enough for the job. Fight to be the person your rational self (Philosophy) wants you to be. Respect reality, help people. Life\u0027s short; the only real win is good character and helping others. Be like Antoninus: committed to reason, always steady, calm, decent, ignored fame, dug deep to understand things. He wasn\u0027t rushed, took criticism without hitting back, ignored slander, checked things out thoroughly, wasn\u0027t blaming, suspicious, or pretending to be wise. Content with basics, worked hard, patient. Solid with friends, tolerated blunt disagreement, happy if someone showed a better way. Respected the divine order without superstition. Aim to die with a clear conscience like him.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Wake Up! It Was Just a Dream:} Snap out of the mental fog. Wake up fully. Realize those things troubling you were just illusions, like bad dreams. Now that you\u0027re awake, see \\textit{reality} clearly, just like you see dreams aren\u0027t real.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Mind Controls Judgment, Body Doesn\u0027t Care:} I\u0027m body and mind. Externals don\u0027t matter to the body – it can\u0027t judge them. Things outside the mind\u0027s own activity (thinking, judging) don\u0027t matter to the mind. It controls its own judgments. And really, it only cares about the \\textit{present} judgment. Past/future judgments are irrelevant right now.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Pain Isn\u0027t \u0027Unnatural\u0027 if You\u0027re Living:} Pain in your foot from walking isn\u0027t against nature; that\u0027s what feet do. So, pain for a human living a human life isn\u0027t \u0027against nature\u0027 either. And if it\u0027s not unnatural, it\u0027s not a true evil \\textit{for you}. It\u0027s just... pain.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Look at Who Enjoys \\textit{That} Stuff:} Think about the twisted kicks criminals, abusers, murderers, and tyrants get. Is \\textit{that} the kind of \u0027pleasure\u0027 worth chasing?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Respect Your Craft (Reason) Like a Pro:} Skilled craftsmen might adapt for amateurs, but they never abandon the core principles of their trade. Isn\u0027t it messed up that an architect or doctor respects their professional rules more than the average person respects their own core principle – Reason, the highest thing we\u0027ve got?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Cosmic Zoom-Out (Again):} Continents? Corners of the map. Oceans? Drops. Mountains? Clods. Time? Pinpricks. It\u0027s all tiny, changing, fading. Everything stems from the same universal source/logic. Even nasty stuff (poison, predators, swamps) are just by-products of the bigger, awesome system. Don\u0027t think they\u0027re \\textit{against} the system; see them as part of the whole picture originating from the single source.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Understand Now, Understand Always:} If you truly get the patterns of what\u0027s happening \\textit{now}, you\u0027ve basically seen it all – past, present, future. It\u0027s all variations on the same fundamental themes.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Everything\u0027s Connected:} Keep thinking about how everything in the universe is linked, related. It\u0027s all woven together, part of one system, following logical sequences driven by cosmic energy, shared spirit, and the unity of all matter.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Adapt and Care:} Fit yourself to your actual circumstances. And the people you\u0027re stuck with? Choose to genuinely care about them.\n\n\\item \\textbf{The Maker Within:} A tool works well if it does its job, but its maker is outside. With natural things (like you), the power that made them is \\textit{inside}. Respect that inner power (Reason). Live according to its will, and you\u0027ll find inner alignment and contentment, just like the universe is aligned with its own nature.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Internal Scoreboard Only:} If you decide external stuff is \u0027good\u0027 or \u0027bad,\u0027 you\u0027ll inevitably blame fate and hate people when things go wrong. If you decide the \\textit{only} real good/bad is in your choices and character, you\u0027ve got no reason to bitch about the universe or resent anyone.\n\n\\item \\textbf{We\u0027re All on the Team (Even the Sleepwalkers):} We\u0027re all working together towards one big outcome, whether we know it or not. Even the clueless \u0027sleepers,\u0027 even the critics and roadblocks – the universe uses them all. Figure out your role and play it well. Don\u0027t be the useless, throwaway part (like the bad verse Chrysippus mentioned).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Different Jobs, Same Goal:} Does the Sun try to do the Rain\u0027s job? Does the healing god try to grow crops? Stars have different roles, but they all work together, right? Same principle applies everywhere.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Trust the Plan (or Trust Yourself):} If the universe/gods planned for me, it\u0027s a good plan (they aren\u0027t stupid or mean). If they only planned for the common good, my life follows from that, so I accept it. If they planned nothing (doubtful), \\textit{I} can still plan for myself based on my rational, social nature. My duty is to my community (Rome) and to humanity (the Universe). What helps them, helps me.\n\n\\item \\textbf{What Helps the Whole, Helps the Part:} Whatever happens to you serves the larger system. That should be enough. But often, what benefits one person also benefits others too (even in neutral ways).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Same Shit, Different Day (But Perspective Helps):} Like watching endless reruns gets boring, life\u0027s cycles can feel repetitive. Same ups, same downs, same sources. How long does this go on? (The implication: Find meaning not in novelty, but in your response).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Remember the Dead, Live for Truth Now:} Think constantly about everyone who\u0027s died – all types, all nations. Famous orators, deep thinkers (Socrates), heroes, kings, brilliant scientists, witty guys, cynics (Menippus). They\u0027re all dust. Was death itself so awful for them? Or for the totally forgotten? The \\textit{only} thing valuable \\textit{now} is living with truth and justice, and being decent even to dishonest or unfair people.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Get a Boost from Good People:} Need to cheer up? Focus on the good qualities you see in people around you \\textit{now}: one person\u0027s energy, another\u0027s kindness, another\u0027s skill. Seeing virtues in action is genuinely uplifting. Keep those examples handy.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Accept Your Portion:} You\u0027re not mad you don\u0027t weigh 500 lbs, right? Or that you won\u0027t live 1000 years? Accept the body you have, accept the lifespan you have. Be content with your allocated slice.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Try, Adapt, Internal Win:} Try to persuade others. But do what\u0027s right \\textit{anyway}, even if they resist, if justice requires it. If they block you forcefully, shift your goal: aim for acceptance and keeping your cool. Use their opposition as practice for another virtue (patience, creativity). Remember you aimed with a \u0027reservation\u0027 – not guaranteeing external success, but aiming to act virtuously \\textit{in the attempt}. That internal goal? You achieved it. What you set out to do \\textit{internally} happened.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Where\u0027s Your \u0027Good\u0027 Located?:} The fame-chaser thinks his good comes from \\textit{others\u0027} activity (their praise). The pleasure-seeker thinks his good is his \\textit{own feelings}. The intelligent person knows their good is their \\textit{own action}.\n\n\\item \\textbf{You Don\u0027t \\textit{Have} to Judge:} You can choose to have no opinion on this external thing, and keep your peace. Things themselves don\u0027t force your judgments onto you.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Listen to Understand:} Make it a real habit: pay attention to what someone else says. Try hard to get inside their perspective.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Team First:} What doesn\u0027t benefit the whole hive doesn\u0027t benefit the individual bee. What\u0027s bad for the community is bad for you.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Trust the Experts (or Who Will You Trust?):} If the sailors constantly diss the captain, or patients diss the doctor, who \\textit{are} they going to listen to? How can the captain keep the ship safe, or the doctor heal anyone, without trust?\n\n\\item \\textbf{They\u0027re Gone Already:} Damn. How many people who started out life around the same time as me are already dead? (A mortality check).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Perception is Reality (For Them):} Jaundice makes honey taste bad. Rabies makes you fear water. A ball is amazing to a kid. Their perception is warped. So why get angry when someone \\textit{else\u0027s} perception is warped by bad judgment or ignorance? Do you think faulty thinking is less powerful than poison?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Your Inner Freedom is Secure:} Nobody can stop you from living according to your own rational nature. And nothing will happen to you that violates the fundamental laws of the universe.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Seriously, \\textit{Who} Are You Trying to Impress?:} Think about the actual people whose approval you crave. What shallow results and actions do \\textit{they} value? And remember how fast eternity covers everything, and how much it\u0027s already covered. Is their fleeting opinion worth compromising for?\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section*{BOOK VII: MEDITATIONS BOOK VII - THE BRO VERSION}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Same Problems, Different Day:} This crap bothering you? Yeah, you\u0027ve seen it before. Get this thought ready for \\textit{any} problem: \"I recognize this pattern.\" Look around – history books, news feeds, your own life – it\u0027s the same human dramas playing out, up and down. Nothing\u0027s truly new. It’s all familiar, and it all passes.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Your Principles Aren\u0027t Dead Unless You Let Them Be:} Your core beliefs only die if the thinking behind them fades out. It\u0027s YOUR job to keep relighting that fire. Think: \"Can I handle this situation rationally? Yes? Then why am I stressed? Stuff outside my direct control can\u0027t actually mess with my \\textit{mind}.\" Get that, and you\u0027re solid. You can always bounce back mentally. Just look at things clearly again, like you did before. That \\textit{is} coming back to life.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Life\u0027s a Weird Show, Know Your Worth:} Fancy ceremonies, drama on TV, herds of sheep, people posturing in meetings, throwing scraps to pets, ants busy as hell, mice freaking out, puppets on strings... Life\u0027s full of this stuff. Your job? Stand tall in the middle of it. Be kind, don\u0027t get arrogant. And understand this: Your real worth is based on what you genuinely value and pursue.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Focus: Listen, Observe, Understand:} When talking, \\textit{really listen} to what\u0027s being said. When acting, \\textit{really see} what\u0027s happening and why. Dig for the underlying meaning and the root cause.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Use Your Brain or Get Help:} Is your head sharp enough for this job? If yes, use it – it’s the tool Nature gave you. If not, either step back and let someone better handle it (if that’s the right move overall), OR do the best you can \\textit{with backup}. Team up with someone whose skills complement yours to get the job done for the common good. Bottom line: whatever you do, alone or with others, it should aim to help the whole team, the bigger picture.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Fame? Gone Faster Than You Think:} How many people who were once famous are totally forgotten now? And how many people who sang their praises are long dead too? So much for leaving a legacy through fame.\n\n\\item \\textbf{No Shame in Getting a Hand:} Don\u0027t be embarrassed to need help. Your job is to get your mission done, like a soldier scaling a wall. If you\u0027re injured and can\u0027t do it alone, you get help. Mission first.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Future You Has Got This:} Stop stressing about the future. If and when you get there, you\u0027ll face it with the exact same reasoning skills you\u0027re using right now to handle today. You’re already equipped.\n\n\\item \\textbf{It\u0027s All Connected, Man:} Everything\u0027s woven together in one sacred web. Hardly anything is truly separate. It\u0027s all arranged together, forming one orderly universe. One reality, one underlying principle (God/Nature), one basic substance, one law, one shared Reason for all thinking beings, one truth. We\u0027re all part of the same system, playing on the same team.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Stuff Vanishes, Causes Merge, Memory Fades:} Physical things disappear back into the cosmic soup super fast. The \u0027why\u0027 behind things gets absorbed into the big picture real quick. And the memory of anything? Buried by time even faster.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Rational \u003d Natural (For Us):} For a thinking creature like you, acting reasonably \\textit{is} acting according to your nature. They\u0027re the same thing.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Stand Tall:** Either stand upright by your own strength, or be \\textit{kept} upright by your principles.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Member, Not Just Part:} Thinking beings are made for cooperation, like limbs on a body. Really grasp this by thinking: \"I am a \\textit{member} of the system of rational beings.\" If you just call yourself a \u0027part\u0027 (like a disconnected piece), you don\u0027t truly love people yet. Doing good isn\u0027t just a chore you \\textit{have} to do; it\u0027s something that benefits \\textit{you} because you\u0027re benefiting the whole you belong to.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Externals Can\u0027t Hurt Your Core:} Let outside events hit whatever physical or emotional parts they can hit. Those parts can complain if they want. But \\textit{you} – your core self, your judgment center – aren\u0027t harmed unless you \\textit{decide} to view the event as evil. And that decision? It\u0027s entirely up to you.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Be Unshakeably You (Good):} No matter what anyone else does or says, your job is to be fundamentally good. Just like gold stays gold, emeralds stay green. Stick to your core nature, maintain your integrity.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Your Mind is Its Own Boss (Unless It Abdicates):} Your core self doesn\u0027t need to freak itself out or chase stupid desires. If someone \\textit{else} can cause you pain or fear, let them try. Your mind won\u0027t automatically fold and adopt those feelings unless it \\textit{agrees} with the judgment that something bad is happening. Let the body take care of itself, let feelings signal things, but the central command – your judgment – doesn\u0027t suffer unless it \\textit{chooses} to interpret things badly. It has no needs unless it creates them; it\u0027s untroubled unless it troubles itself.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Happiness \u003d Good Inner State:} Real happiness is having a strong inner character, a good internal guide. See those nagging negative thoughts, those \u0027imagination phantoms\u0027? Tell them: \"Beat it! Seriously, get lost. I don\u0027t need you. You\u0027re just an old bad habit. I\u0027m not pissed, just... leave.\"\n\n\\item \\textbf{Seriously, You Fear Change?:} Scared of change? How does \\textit{anything} useful happen without it? Can you take a hot shower without wood changing into heat? Can you eat without food changing? Can \\textit{any} progress occur without change? Your own personal changes are exactly the same – natural, necessary, and part of how the universe works.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Everyone Flows Through:} All bodies pass through the universe like debris in a flood. We\u0027re connected to the whole, cooperating with it, like our own limbs work together. Think how many brilliant minds (Chrysippus, Socrates, Epictetus) time has already swept away. Apply that same thought to \\textit{every} person, \\textit{every} thing. Nothing lasts forever in its current form.\n\n\\item \\textbf{My Only Real Concern:} The single thing that truly worries me is the possibility of \\textit{me} doing something that goes against rational human nature, or doing it the wrong way, or doing something that just isn\u0027t right for \\textit{this} moment. My own screw-ups are the only real threat.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Forgetting and Being Forgotten:} You\u0027re close to forgetting everything. And everything is close to forgetting you.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Love People, Even Screw-Ups:} It\u0027s fundamentally human to love even those who mess up. This clicks when you realize: they\u0027re family (humanity), they screw up out of ignorance or weakness (not pure evil, usually against their better judgment), you\u0027ll \\textit{both} be dead soon enough, and crucially – they didn\u0027t actually harm your \\textit{inner self}, your core ability to judge and act right.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Nature Recycles Endlessly:} The Universe uses matter like wax – makes a horse, melts it, makes a tree, melts it, makes a person, melts it... Each form lasts only a little while. It\u0027s no hardship for a wooden box to be taken apart; it wasn\u0027t a big deal when it was nailed together. Same principle applies to us. It\u0027s just change.\n\n\\item \\textbf{A Scowl is Anti-Reason:} A constantly angry or frowning face is deeply unnatural. Keep it up, and the expression either freezes that way or dies out, losing its capacity for warmth. Try to get this: it\u0027s against Reason. If you even lose the \\textit{awareness} that you\u0027re acting wrongly, what reason is left for living?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Constant Refresh Button:} Nature, running the whole show, will change everything you see almost instantly. It\u0027ll make new things from the old materials, and then newer things from those. That\u0027s how the world stays fresh and young.\n\n\\item \\textbf{See Their Bad Logic, Find Pity:} Someone wrongs you? Immediately figure out \\textit{their} flawed idea of \u0027good\u0027 or \u0027bad\u0027 that drove them. Once you see their messed-up perspective, you\u0027ll feel pity, not shock or anger. Maybe you still hold some similar bad ideas yourself? Then you \\textit{have} to forgive them. If you\u0027ve moved past those specific errors, you\u0027ll find it even easier to be kind to someone whose thinking is still clouded.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Value What You Have Now, Don\u0027t Cling:} Stop obsessing over things you \\textit{don\u0027t} have as if they\u0027re already here. Instead, focus on the good stuff you \\textit{do} have. Appreciate it. Remind yourself how much you\u0027d miss it if it were gone. \\textit{But}—and this is key—don\u0027t get so attached that you\u0027ll be devastated if it disappears later. Value it, use it, be grateful, but hold it lightly.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Go Inward for Peace:} Retreat into yourself. Your rational core self is naturally content when it acts justly and achieves the calm that comes with it.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Mental Checklist for Clarity:} 1) Wipe away distracting mental images. 2) Stop acting on raw impulse. 3) Define the present moment clearly. 4) Recognize what\u0027s \\textit{really} happening (to you or others). 5) Break down the event: What caused it? What\u0027s it made of? 6) Think about your own final hour. 7) Leave the other person\u0027s wrongdoing where it started – with them.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Track the Action:} Focus your thought on what\u0027s being said. Let your mind penetrate what\u0027s actually happening and who\u0027s driving the action.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Simple Gladness, Love People, Follow Nature:} Make yourself happy with simplicity, self-respect, and being indifferent to the stuff that falls between actual virtue and vice. Love humanity. Follow the natural order (God/Reason). Remember the core truth: reality follows rules. That\u0027s enough.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Death? Scatter, Snuff Out, or Move On:} What happens when you die? Either your atoms scatter, or if you\u0027re a unified thing, you\u0027re extinguished, or you change your address. It\u0027s a transition.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Pain? Can Bear or Can\u0027t:} Pain you literally can\u0027t bear removes you from life (you die). Pain that lasts \\textit{can} be borne. Your mind can keep its cool by detaching. Your core self doesn\u0027t get worse. Let the injured body parts signal pain if they need to.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Fame? Look at Their Minds \\\u0026 Shifting Sands:} Want fame? Look at the minds of the people you want it from – what they chase, what they run from. Besides, fame is like watching sand dunes shift – the old layers get quickly buried by the new. In life, the past is just as quickly buried by what comes next.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Big Picture vs. Mortal Life (Plato):} \u0027Think a mind with real scope, viewing all time and reality, considers this brief mortal life a \\textit{huge} deal?\u0027 \u0027Impossible.\u0027 \u0027So that kind of person won\u0027t see death as terrifying either, right?\u0027 \u0027Absolutely.\u0027\n\n\\item \\textbf{Leader\u0027s Job Description:} Do good work, get criticized for it. That\u0027s the deal.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Mind Should Shape Itself:} Isn\u0027t it absurd that your face obeys your mind\u0027s commands (look serious, smile), but your mind itself often fails to shape \\textit{itself} according to its own rational standards of beauty and order?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Don\u0027t Waste Anger on Things:} \u0027Yelling at rocks won\u0027t help; they don\u0027t care.\u0027 (Don\u0027t get mad at external events or inanimate objects).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Bring Joy (Act Well):} \u0027May you bring joy to the gods and to humans.\u0027 (Live virtuously).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Life\u0027s Harvest:} \u0027Life, like ripe grain, yields to the harvest. One must exist, another must cease.\u0027 (Accept mortality\u0027s cycle).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Reason Remains:} \u0027Even if the gods ignored me and mine, there\u0027s still reason in the universe.\u0027 (Trust the underlying order).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Goodness is My Ally:} \u0027Righteousness and Goodness are on my side.\u0027 (Confidence in virtue).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Don\u0027t Absorb Misery:} \u0027Don\u0027t mourn \\textit{with} them; don\u0027t get sucked into their emotional chaos.\u0027 (Show support, don\u0027t catch the disease).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Socrates: Right vs. Wrong is the Only Question:} \u0027My answer: You\u0027re mistaken, friend, if you think anyone worthwhile should calculate risks of life or death. The only question when acting is: Am I doing right or wrong? Acting like a good person or a bad one?\u0027\n\n\\item \\textbf{Socrates: Duty Before Safety:} \u0027Honestly, Athenians, it\u0027s like this: Wherever you take your post, believing it\u0027s best, or where your leader places you, you \\textit{must} stay and face the danger, considering nothing—death or anything else—compared to acting dishonorably.\u0027\n\n\\item \\textbf{Socrates: Best Life, Not Longest Life:} \u0027But maybe real courage isn\u0027t just about saving your skin. Maybe a true man puts aside trying to live as long as possible, doesn\u0027t cling to life, trusts the bigger picture (God/Fate), and focuses \\textit{only} on living the \\textit{best possible} life in the time he\u0027s got.\u0027\n\n\\item \\textbf{Cosmic View Cleans Your Head:} Watch the stars move like you\u0027re running alongside them. Constantly think about how elements change into one another. These big-picture thoughts wash away the dirt and grime of petty daily worries.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Look Down on Earthly Chaos:} When thinking about humanity, imagine looking down from space: herds, armies, farms, weddings, divorces, births, deaths, noisy courts, empty deserts, different cultures, parties, funerals, markets – the whole chaotic mix, an order made of opposites. See the patterns.\n\n\\item \\textbf{History Repeats (Human Nature is Stable):} Look at the past – endless rise and fall of powers. You can predict the future too; it\u0027ll follow similar patterns because human nature doesn\u0027t fundamentally change that fast. Studying 40 years of human life tells you as much as studying 10,000. What more are you really going to see?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Back to Earth, Spirit to Sky (Or Atoms Scatter):} \u0027Earthly parts return to earth; the divine spark returns to the heavens.\u0027 Or maybe it\u0027s just the atoms unlinking and scattering.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Trying to Dodge Fate:} (Quotes about using magic or tricks to avoid death/fate). Pointless. \u0027You gotta face the winds God sends, and keep working without whining.\u0027\n\n\\item \\textbf{Different Kinds of \u0027Better\u0027:} Someone might be a \u0027better wrestler\u0027 (stronger, more skilled physically), but does that make them more cooperative, more modest, better prepared for life\u0027s twists, or kinder to neighbors\u0027 faults? Don\u0027t confuse physical prowess with character.\n\n\\item \\textbf{No Fear Where Reason Guides:} If a task can be done following the shared principles of reason (common to humans and the universe/gods), there\u0027s nothing to fear. Where you can get benefit by acting rationally and according to your nature, there\u0027s no real harm to suspect.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Your Constant Power:} Everywhere, always, you \\textit{can} choose to: 1) Be genuinely okay with your current situation (acceptance). 2) Treat people around you fairly (justice). 3) Analyze your current thoughts skillfully, so no unexamined crap gets through (clarity).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Follow Your Nature (Rational \\\u0026 Social):} Don\u0027t get lost looking at other people\u0027s internal states. Look straight ahead to where Nature leads you – Universal Nature through external events, and your \\textit{own} nature through your duties. Each thing must do what it\u0027s built for. Other creatures exist for the sake of rational ones; rational ones exist for each other. So your primary job is: 1) Be social, contribute. 2) Master your body\u0027s urges (Reason rules senses). 3) Avoid snap judgments, don\u0027t be fooled. Stick to these, walk a straight path, and you possess what is truly yours – your character.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Live the Rest Like Bonus Time:} Act as if you already died, and this moment forward is extra innings. Use the remaining time to live properly, according to Nature.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Love What\u0027s Yours:} Love only your actual path, your own destiny, what life assigns you. What could possibly suit you better?\n\n\\item \\textbf{See the Pattern, Choose Differently:} When something bad happens, immediately think of others who faced the same thing. Remember how they freaked out, were shocked, complained. Where are they now? Gone. Do you want to end up reacting like them? Ditch those emotional reactions. Focus \\textit{entirely} on how \\textit{you} can use this situation constructively. The event is just raw material. Pay attention, resolve to be fair to yourself in your response. Remember both: what you do \\textit{internally} matters immensely; the \\textit{external} situation itself is ultimately neutral.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Dig Within:} Keep digging inside yourself. The source of good is in there, always ready to bubble up if you just keep digging for it.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Composed Body, Too:} Your body should also be held with composure, not sloppy or agitated, whether moving or still. Just as your mind aims for intelligence and grace, your body should reflect that. But don\u0027t be artificial or stiff about it.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Life \u003d Wrestling, Not Dancing:} The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing. You need to be prepared, balanced, and ready to handle unexpected challenges, not just smoothly executing planned moves.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Whose Applause Do You Want?:} Constantly consider \\textit{who} these people are whose approval you seek. Look at \\textit{their} core principles. If you understand the source of their judgments and impulses, you won\u0027t blame them when they inevitably stumble, nor will you desperately need their validation.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Nobody \\textit{Wants} to Be Wrong:} Remember this: \u0027No soul is willingly deprived of truth.\u0027 The same goes for justice, self-control, kindness. Keep this firmly in mind; it\u0027ll make you gentler towards everyone.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Pain: Not Evil, Limits Apply:} Facing any pain, have this ready: \"This isn\u0027t morally evil. It doesn\u0027t injure my core intelligence.\" It can\u0027t destroy your rational/social self. For most pains, Epicurus\u0027s advice helps: \u0027Pain is either unbearable (and thus short) or long (and thus bearable). Remember its limits, and don\u0027t add extra suffering with your imagination.\u0027 Also, recognize that many unpleasant things (drowsiness, intense heat, loss of appetite) are just forms of pain. When you feel gross, tell yourself: \u0027You are giving in to pain.\u0027\n\n\\item \\textbf{Don\u0027t Mirror Inhumanity:} Make sure you don\u0027t start feeling towards inhuman people the same way \\textit{they} feel towards humanity. Don\u0027t let their cruelty corrupt you.\n\n\\item \\textbf{True Character vs. Surface Fame (Socrates):} How do we \\textit{really} know if some unknown guy (Telauges) wasn\u0027t better than famous Socrates? It\u0027s not enough that Socrates had a famous death, argued well, endured cold, made brave stands, or walked proudly. We have to ask: What was his \\textit{soul} like? Was he content just being fair to people and respectful to the gods/reality? Did he handle wickedness without flying off the handle? Was he patient with ignorance? Did he accept his fate without seeing it as alien or unbearable? Did he keep his mind from being bossed around by his body\u0027s feelings? \\textit{That\u0027s} the real test.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Godlike is Possible for Anyone:} Nature didn\u0027t lock you into the world so tightly that you can\u0027t carve out your own space and control what\u0027s yours. Always remember: a truly blessed life depends on very few things. Just because you aren\u0027t a genius philosopher or scientist doesn\u0027t mean you can\u0027t be free, modest, helpful to others, and aligned with reality (God). It\u0027s possible to become truly godlike in character even if nobody ever recognizes it.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Live Free and Glad, No Matter What:} Live your life unrestrained, fully glad, even if everyone screams insults, even if wild beasts tear apart this physical shell you wear. What\u0027s stopping your mind from staying calm, judging surroundings accurately, and readily using whatever comes its way? Your judgment tells events: \"This is what you are in reality, even if you look different.\" Your ability to act tells resources: \"Ah, I was looking for you. The present moment is \\textit{always} raw material for virtue, for the art of being human or godlike.\" Whatever happens fits the universal plan; it\u0027s not new or impossible, just familiar stuff to handle well.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Mark of Excellence:} Live each day as if it were your last. Avoid both frantic agitation and lazy apathy. Don\u0027t just play a role; be authentic.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Gods Tolerate Fools, So Can You (Briefly):} The immortal gods aren\u0027t perpetually annoyed that they have to put up with so many flawed humans forever; they even help them out. You, who are about to vanish any second, are giving up the effort? Even though you\u0027re one of the flawed ones yourself? Come on.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Flee Your Own Bad Habits, Not Others\u0027:} It\u0027s ridiculous \\textit{not} to escape your own vices (which \\textit{is} possible), while trying to flee other people\u0027s vices (which is \\textit{impossible*). Focus on your own improvement.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Reason Filters:} Whatever your rational and social faculty finds to be \\textit{not} intelligent or social, it rightly judges as beneath its concern.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Do Good, Move On:} You did a good deed for someone. Why do you need a third thing, like a fool – needing to be \\textit{seen} doing good, or expecting a reward? The action itself is the point.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Giving Benefits You Too:} Nobody gets tired of receiving help. And helping others \\textit{is} acting according to Nature. So don\u0027t get tired of the \u0027benefit\u0027 \\textit{you} receive by \\textit{doing} good deeds. It reinforces your own virtuous nature.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section*{BOOK VIII: MEDITATIONS BOOK VIII - THE BRO VERSION}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Drop the Philosopher Act, Just Live Right:} Forget needing that fancy \"philosopher\" reputation. You know you\u0027re not perfect, probably far from it, and so does everyone else. It\u0027s not easy to fake it anyway, and life\u0027s pulling you in other directions. So, ditch worrying about what people think. Just figure out what your \\textit{own nature} truly wants and live the rest of your life – however long that is – according to \\textit{that}. Nothing else should distract you. You\u0027ve already tried a bunch of dead ends – chasing logic tricks, money, fame, pleasure – none of it delivered the good life. So where is it? In doing what a human is built to do. How? By sticking to solid principles about good and bad: knowing that nothing\u0027s truly \\textit{good} for you unless it makes you fair, self-controlled, brave, and free; and nothing\u0027s truly \\textit{bad} unless it does the opposite.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Quick Gut Check on Actions:} Before you do anything, ask: \"How does this line up with \\textit{me}? Will I regret this later? Look, I\u0027m gonna be dead soon, and all this stuff disappears. So, what more do I need than just doing solid work \\textit{right now} – the work of a thinking, social creature living under the same rules as everyone else?\"\n\n\\item \\textbf{Big Shots vs. Real Thinkers:} Alexander, Caesar, Pompey – yeah, famous names. But stack \u0027em against guys like Diogenes, Heraclitus, Socrates? Those thinkers actually \\textit{understood} reality, its causes, its substance. Their minds were their own. The famous rulers? They were constantly worrying about a million external things, basically slaves to circumstance and their possessions.\n\n\\item \\textbf{They\u0027ll Do Them Anyway:} You can absolutely lose your mind over what other people do, get totally worked up... and they\u0027re still gonna do exactly what they were gonna do. Your outrage changes nothing for them.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Stay Calm, Know Your Job:} First rule: don\u0027t get rattled. Everything follows the grand plan of Nature, and in a blink, you\u0027ll be gone, just like Hadrian and Augustus. Gone. So, look hard at the situation, get its core truth. Remind yourself: your mission is to be a good person. Figure out what human nature actually asks of you, and \\textit{do that}, no excuses. Speak what seems right and just, but do it with kindness, humility, and zero fakeness.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Nature\u0027s Shuffle:} The Universe\u0027s job is constant change: moving things from here to there, transforming them, taking them away, bringing new stuff in. It\u0027s all just shuffling the deck. The assignments might seem random, but they\u0027re impartial. It\u0027s all familiar patterns, nothing truly new under the sun to be terrified of.\n\n\\item \\textbf{What Makes a Rational Mind Thrive:} Anything in nature is content when it\u0027s doing well according to its design. A rational mind does well when it: a) Doesn\u0027t buy into lies or fuzzy thinking. b) Directs its energy towards helping the team (society). c) Only desires or avoids things genuinely within its control. d) Welcomes whatever the universe deals out. Your nature is part of that big, unstoppable, fair system, just like a leaf is part of a plant (except your nature is rational and free, unlike the leaf\u0027s). It dishes out time, stuff, causes, actions, experiences fairly, according to worth. Don\u0027t get bogged down comparing tiny details; check if the whole picture makes sense.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Play the Hand You\u0027re Dealt (Inner Strengths):} Okay, maybe you\u0027re not a genius scholar, can\u0027t read super fast. Fine. But you \\textit{can} curb your arrogance. You \\textit{can} rise above being jerked around by pleasure and pain. You \\textit{can} be indifferent to fame. You \\textit{can} choose not to get pissed off at clueless or ungrateful people, and maybe even try to look out for them. Focus on the powers you \\textbf{do} have.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Zero Whining Allowed:} Let nobody – not even yourself – hear you complaining about your life situation (even if it\u0027s a \u0027palace\u0027). Shut that down.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Regret is Pointless for Pleasure:} Regret means blaming yourself for missing something genuinely useful. Real good has to be useful and worth a truly good person\u0027s time. Would a truly good person beat themselves up for missing out on some fleeting pleasure? Hell no. Therefore, that kind of pleasure isn\u0027t genuinely useful or fundamentally good.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Break It Down:} What is this thing, really? On its own? What\u0027s its core substance? What caused it? What\u0027s its purpose in the world? How long is it designed to last? Analyze it.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Why Getting Up Matters:} Tough time waking up? Remember this: getting up and doing social things, contributing – that\u0027s core to your human design. Just sleeping? Animals do that too. What\u0027s truly aligned with your \\textit{nature} should feel more essential, more fitting, even ultimately more satisfying.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Triple-Check Your Thoughts:} Constantly, maybe every time a strong thought or feeling hits you, run it through these filters: 1) Physics (What are the physical facts?). 2) Ethics (What\u0027s the right way to handle this?). 3) Logic (Does this thought actually make sense?).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Know Their Operating System:} Meet someone new? Immediately try to figure out: \"What are this person\u0027s core beliefs about good/bad, pleasure/pain, status, life/death?\" Because if you understand their \u0027operating system,\u0027 their actions won\u0027t surprise you. You\u0027ll just recognize they\u0027re acting according to their programming, flawed or not.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Stop Being Surprised by the Obvious:} It\u0027s absurd to be shocked that fig trees bear figs. It\u0027s just as absurd for a doctor to be shocked by a fever, or a sailor by a headwind. Stop being surprised when things act according to their nature – including people.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Changing Your Mind is Freedom:} Realizing you\u0027re wrong and following someone who corrects you doesn\u0027t make you less free. That change \\textit{is} your own action, based on your own impulse, your own decision, your own rational mind adapting. That\u0027s exercising your freedom.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Blame Game is Stupid:} If the decision is yours, why screw it up? If it\u0027s someone else\u0027s fault, who are you gonna blame? Random atoms? The gods? Both are insane. Blame \\textit{no one}. If you can, correct the person. If not, correct the situation itself. If you can\u0027t even do that, what\u0027s the point of blaming? It achieves nothing. Do things with a purpose.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Nothing Leaves the Universe:} Stuff that dies doesn\u0027t fall off the map. It stays here, changes form, breaks down into the basic elements – the same elements that make up you and everything else. And those elements? They change constantly and don\u0027t throw a fit about it.\n\n\\item \\textbf{What\u0027s Your Purpose? (Hint: Not Just Fun):} Everything has a purpose – a horse, a vine. Even the Sun god would say, \"I have a job.\" The other gods too. So, what are \\textit{you} here for? Just to enjoy yourself? Does that idea even stand up to scrutiny?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Beginnings, Middles, Ends - All Natural:} Nature designed endings just like beginnings and the stuff in between. It\u0027s like throwing a ball – is it \u0027good\u0027 for the ball to go up? \u0027Bad\u0027 for it to come down? \u0027Bad\u0027 for a bubble to pop? Same for a candle burning out. It\u0027s just the natural process. Don\u0027t make it a moral drama.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Zoom Out: See the Smallness:} Turn things inside out. See what they\u0027re like when old, sick, decaying. The praiser and the praised, the rememberer and the remembered – all gone in a flash. We live in a tiny corner of the planet, nobody agrees on everything, we barely agree with ourselves. The whole Earth is just a speck. Keep perspective.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Focus on What Matters:} Pay attention to the actual subject, the action needed, the underlying principle, or the real meaning. If you choose to be good \\textit{tomorrow} instead of \\textit{today}, you deserve the friction you feel.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Connect Actions \\\u0026 Events:} Am I \\textit{doing} something? I frame it in terms of helping people. Does something \\textit{happen to} me? I accept it, framing it as part of the bigger picture, linked to the source of all things.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Life\u0027s Grimy Details:} Think about taking a bath – soap, sweat, dirt, oily water, kinda gross when you break it down. Well, every part of life, every object, has that mundane, \u0027unglamorous\u0027 aspect if you look closely enough. It\u0027s just reality.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Everyone Dies - Even the Smart \\\u0026 Proud:} Remember Lucilla burying Verus, then dying? Secunda burying Maximus, then dying? Antoninus burying Faustina, then dying? Same story, repeat forever. Celer buried Hadrian, then died. Where are those sharp minds now? The fortune-tellers? The arrogant big shots like Charax, Demetrius, Eudaemon? All short-lived, dead long ago. Some forgotten instantly, some just legends now, some legends even fading. Remember this: Your own body is destined to break apart, your spirit to be extinguished or maybe relocated. Impermanence is king.\n\n\\item \\textbf{The Real Joy of Being Human:} A person\u0027s true happiness comes from doing their proper work: being kind to fellow humans, mastering sensory impulses, seeing through fake mental images, and contemplating Universal Nature and how it operates.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Your Three Connections:} You exist in relation to three things: 1) Your immediate environment/circumstances. 2) The divine source/cause from which everything flows. 3) The other people alive right now alongside you.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Pain Can\u0027t Touch Your Core:} Pain might be bad for the body – let the body signal that. But the soul? It has the power to stay calm and \\textit{not} judge pain as an ultimate evil. All your judgments, impulses, desires, and avoidances are \\textit{internal}. Nothing truly evil can force its way into that inner sanctum.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Mental Hygiene Power:} Wipe out negative mental impressions constantly. Tell yourself: \"Right now, it\u0027s in my power to refuse entry to any wickedness, any uncontrolled appetite, any disturbance in my soul. I can see these things for what they are and use each according to its actual worth.\" Remember you have this natural power.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Speak Plainly, Speak Truly:} Whether you\u0027re in the boardroom (Senate) or talking to anyone else, speak appropriately, without putting on airs. Use words that are straightforward and true.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Entire Courts Die Out:} Think of Augustus\u0027s whole world – wife, daughter, grandkids, stepkids, sister, buddies like Agrippa, advisors like Maecenas, doctors, priests – that entire court is dead. Now think of other powerful families, like Pompey\u0027s – whole lines wiped out. Remember those tomb inscriptions: \"Last of his line.\" Imagine the anxiety of previous generations trying to secure an heir, only for it to end anyway. Whole family trees, gone.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Plan Action by Action, Adapt:} Structure your life one action at a time. Be content if each step achieves its purpose as best it can. Nobody can stop you from aiming correctly. An external obstacle blocks Plan A? Fine. It \\textit{cannot} block you from acting justly, temperately, and thoughtfully \\textit{in response}. Maybe it hinders that specific \\textit{activity}? Okay. Accept the obstacle, adapt gracefully to what \\textit{is} possible, and substitute a new right action (Plan B) that fits into your overall goal of living well.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Take It or Leave It (Externals):} Accept good fortune without pride; let go of things without clinging or struggle.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Rejoining the Whole:} Ever seen a severed limb lying separate? That\u0027s what you do to yourself, metaphorically, when you fight reality or act antisocially – you cut yourself off from the natural unity. You were born a part; now you\u0027ve made yourself an outcast. But here’s the amazing thing: unlike a physical limb, you \\textit{can} rejoin the whole. Nature/God gave humans this unique ability. Try not to sever yourself in the first place, but if you do, know you can always reconnect, grow back, and reclaim your place as a contributing part.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Turn Obstacles into Fuel:} Just like Nature takes roadblocks and incorporates them into its own system, you got the same power from her. You, as a rational being, can take \\textit{any} obstacle and make it material, use it as fuel for whatever purpose (virtuous action) you were originally aiming for.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Focus on the Present Burden:} Don\u0027t let the vague idea of \\textit{all} your life\u0027s problems overwhelm you. Don\u0027t get lost in past regrets or future anxieties. For \\textit{every present task}, ask yourself: \"What part of \\textit{this specific thing} is actually unbearable?\" You\u0027ll likely be embarrassed to admit, \"Not much.\" Remember: it\u0027s not the past or future crushing you, it\u0027s \\textit{always} the present moment. And the present shrinks if you just isolate it. If your mind feels weak facing it, call it out: \"Seriously, you can\u0027t handle just \\textit{this}?\"\n\n\\item \\textbf{Absurdity of Endless Mourning:} Are Panthea or Pergamos \\textit{still} sitting by Verus\u0027s tomb? Chabrias or Diotimus by Hadrian\u0027s? That\u0027s absurd! If they were, would the dead even know? If they knew, would they care? If they cared, would the mourners live forever? Weren\u0027t they \\textit{also} fated to get old and die? And after they died, what then? This obsessive grieving is just focusing on decay – stink, blood, dust.\n\n\\item \\textbf{See Clearly, Judge Wisely:} If you\u0027ve got sharp insight, then \\textit{use it}. See things as they are and make the wisest judgment call you can.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Justice vs. Pleasure:} In the setup of a rational being, I see no virtue that naturally opposes justice/fairness. But I \\textit{do} see one that opposes pleasure: self-control.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Your Judgment IS the Pain:} Cancel your \\textit{judgment} about the thing that seems to be causing you pain, and \\textit{you yourself} stand firm, unshaken. \"What is \u0027yourself\u0027?\" Reason. \"But I\u0027m not \\textit{just} reason!\" Okay, granted. Then don\u0027t let your Reason itself get troubled. If some other part of you (body, emotions) feels harmed, let \\textit{that part} form its own opinion about itself, but keep your core Reason steady.\n\n\\item \\textbf{What \\textit{Really} Gets Hindered?:} Blocking senses or impulses harms an animal\u0027s nature. Blocking \\textit{reason} harms a rational nature. Apply this: Pain and pleasure might affect your senses – let the senses report that. Was your impulse blocked? If you were charging ahead without thinking (without reservation), then yes, the block \\textit{is} harmful to you \\textit{as a rational being} (because you acted irrationally). But if you accept it as just how things go sometimes, you aren\u0027t truly hurt or hindered. Remember, the core properties of your mind – your reason, judgment – nobody else can really mess with. Fire, steel, tyrants, insults – they can\u0027t touch it once it becomes that stable, self-contained \u0027sphere\u0027.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Don\u0027t Inflict Pain on Yourself:} I don\u0027t deserve to cause myself mental anguish, because I\u0027ve never intentionally caused others pain. (Treat yourself fairly).\n\n\\item \\textbf{My Joy: Inner Integrity \\\u0026 Acceptance:} Different things make different people happy. My joy comes from keeping my core self (governing reason) intact: not turning my back on any person or any event that happens, but seeing everything with kind eyes, welcoming each situation, and using it according to its actual value.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Forget Future Fame, Focus Now:} Make sure you use this present time for \\textit{yourself}. People chasing fame from future generations forget that those future people will be just like the flawed folks around now (whom they probably find annoying!), and \\textit{they} will be mortal too. What earthly good is their hypothetical future opinion of you going to do \\textit{you}?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Inner Peace Anywhere:} \"Throw me wherever you want.\" I can keep my inner divinity calm and satisfied there, as long as \\textit{I} act consistently with my own rational constitution. Is \\textit{this} external situation really a good enough reason for my soul to be messed up – degraded, humbled, needy, trapped, panicking? What possible reason could justify that?\n\n\\item \\textbf{It\u0027s Just Human Stuff:} Nothing can happen to a person that isn\u0027t part of the normal human experience. Just like oxen deal with ox stuff, vines with vine stuff, stones with stone stuff. If what\u0027s happening is standard and natural for your kind, why are you freaking out? Universal Nature didn\u0027t give you something you fundamentally cannot bear.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Your Judgment is the Escape Hatch:} If you\u0027re suffering because of something external, remember: the thing itself isn\u0027t the problem, your \\textit{judgment} about it is. You can wipe out that judgment \\textit{right now}. If the pain comes from your own mindset, who\u0027s stopping you from correcting your thinking? If you\u0027re pained because you\u0027re failing at some action you believe is right, why not keep \\textit{acting} instead of just feeling pain? \"But there\u0027s an obstacle I can\u0027t overcome!\" Fine, then don\u0027t be pained – the reason the action isn\u0027t done isn\u0027t your fault. \"But life isn\u0027t worth living if I can\u0027t do this!\" Okay, then check out peacefully, like someone finishing their race, content even with the things that opposed you.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Reason: Your Inner Fortress:} Remember, your core self – your reason – becomes invincible when it withdraws into itself, is satisfied with itself, and does only what \\textit{it} wills (even if that seems stubborn to others). How much more powerful is it when it makes decisions rationally and carefully? Because of this, a mind free from emotional chaos is a fortress. You have no stronger place to retreat where you\u0027ll be truly safe. Anyone who hasn\u0027t seen this is ignorant; anyone who sees it but doesn\u0027t retreat there is tragically missing out.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Stick to First Reports:} Don\u0027t add layers of drama to the initial facts. Someone tells you, \"So-and-so is talking trash about you.\" Okay, that\u0027s the report. You \\textit{haven\u0027t} been told you were actually harmed. You see your kid is sick. Okay, you see symptoms. You \\textit{don\u0027t} automatically see mortal danger. Stick to these first impressions, add nothing extra from your own head, and that\u0027s it. Or, maybe add one thing: the calm understanding that this kind of stuff happens in the world.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Nature\u0027s Recycling Plant:} Cucumber\u0027s bitter? Toss it. Brambles in the way? Step around them. Enough said. Don\u0027t get bogged down asking, \"Why does stuff like this even exist?\" A student of nature would laugh – like a carpenter would laugh if you complained about sawdust in their workshop. Sure, they have trash cans, but Universal Nature has nothing \\textit{outside} herself. The amazing thing is how she works: she sets limits, then constantly transforms everything within those limits that seems to be decaying, old, or useless, and creates new, young things out of the very same material. She doesn\u0027t need external resources or a place to dump waste. She\u0027s self-sufficient with her own space, her own matter, her own methods.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Stay Sharp, Stay Calm, Stay Free:} Don\u0027t be lazy in action, confused in speech, or wandering in your thoughts. Basically: don\u0027t withdraw into a shell, don\u0027t explode with emotion, and make sure you leave room for rest in your life. People kill you, cut you up, curse you? What does that \\textit{have} to do with your mind staying pure, sane, self-controlled, and just? It\u0027s like someone standing by a clear, sweet spring and cursing it. The spring keeps bubbling up fresh water. Throw mud or crap in it? It quickly breaks it down, washes it away, and stays clean. How do you get that kind of inner, ever-flowing fountain (not just a stagnant tank)? By guarding your freedom every hour, staying content, simple, and aligned with nature (reverent).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Know Your Place, Know Yourself:} If someone doesn\u0027t know the Universe exists (as an ordered whole), they don\u0027t know where they are. If they don\u0027t know its purpose, they don\u0027t know who \\textit{they} are or what the Universe is. Fail on any of these, and you couldn\u0027t even state your own reason for being born. So what do you think of someone who avoids criticism or chases praise from people who applaud, yet don\u0027t know where \\textit{they} are or who \\textit{they} are?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Consider the Source of Praise:} Do you really want praise from someone who curses themselves three times an hour? Do you want to please someone who isn\u0027t pleased with \\textit{themselves}? Is someone who regrets almost everything they do actually pleased with themselves? Think about it.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Breathe the Cosmic Mind:} Don\u0027t just breathe the physical air around you; start thinking with the universal Mind that surrounds everything. That mental power is poured out everywhere, available for anyone willing to absorb it, just like air is available for anyone able to breathe it.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Evil\u0027s Limited Reach:} Generally, evil doesn\u0027t harm the Universe itself. And specifically, a particular evil doesn\u0027t harm your neighbor\u0027s \\textit{core self}. It only \"injures\" the person it happens to, and they have the power to free themselves from that perceived injury (by changing their judgment) whenever they choose.\n\n\\item \\textbf{My Mind is Mine, Yours is Yours:} My neighbor\u0027s choices are as indifferent to my core self as their physical body is. Yes, we were born primarily for each other\u0027s sake, but each of our minds (governing selves) is sovereign. If it weren\u0027t, my neighbor\u0027s screw-up would automatically be \\textit{my} problem, my misery. That wasn\u0027t the plan – my happiness isn\u0027t supposed to depend on someone else.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Understanding Spreads Like Light:} Sunlight seems poured down, and it extends in all directions, but it doesn\u0027t get \"used up.\" This pouring is extension – hence \"rays\" (from \\textit{extendere}). You see how a ray works: light streams through a crack into a dark room, travels straight, and stops cleanly on whatever solid object it hits, lighting it up without sliding off or falling. The way your understanding spreads should be similar: not a messy spill, but a focused extension. It shouldn\u0027t crash violently against obstacles or just give up. It should remain steady and illuminate whatever it encounters. Anything that doesn\u0027t receive the light simply remains in the dark – it robs itself.\n\n\\item \\textbf{What\u0027s to Fear in Death?:} Anyone afraid of death is afraid of either 1) losing consciousness completely, or 2) having a different \\textit{kind} of consciousness. If it\u0027s \\#1, you won\u0027t be aware of anything bad, so no problem. If it\u0027s \\#2, you\u0027ll just be a different kind of creature, and you won\u0027t stop living, just living differently. So, where\u0027s the terror?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Teach or Tolerate:} People exist for one another. So, either teach them better or patiently put up with them.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Mind\u0027s Direct Path:} An arrow\u0027s flight path is physical. The mind\u0027s path is different. But when the mind is cautious, focused, and investigating something, its path is still direct and aimed right at its objective.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Understand and Be Understood:} Make an effort to get inside the head (governing self) of everyone you deal with. And let them get inside yours. Openness and understanding go both ways.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section*{BOOK IX: MEDITATIONS BOOK IX - THE BRO VERSION}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Doing Wrong Messes with the System (and Yourself):} Anyone who acts unfairly screws up. Why? Because the Universe (Nature) made thinking creatures to help each other out based on what\u0027s deserved, definitely \\textit{not} to harm each other. Screw with that basic principle? You\u0027re disrespecting the most fundamental reality (the gods, Nature, whatever). That\u0027s a sin against the system.\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{Lying Too:} Same deal for lying. Nature/Truth is the basis of everything real. Lie on purpose? You\u0027re causing harm through deceit. Lie unintentionally? You\u0027re still out of sync, fighting against the natural order by confusing things. You got the tools from Nature to tell truth from falsehood – if you neglect them and spread BS, you\u0027re creating chaos.\n        \\item \\textbf{Chasing Pleasure/Avoiding Pain Blindly:} Sinful too. Why? Because if you think pleasure is the ultimate good and pain the ultimate evil, you\u0027ll constantly bitch about Nature giving good stuff (pleasure) to bad people and hard times (pain) to good people. You\u0027ll resent reality\u0027s distribution system. Plus, fear of pain leads to fearing natural events, and chasing pleasure makes you likely to act unfairly to get it. Obvious screw-up.\n        \\item \\textbf{The Right Way:} If you want to align with Nature, be like her: indifferent to things she treats indifferently (pain/pleasure, death/life, fame/obscurity). If you \\textit{aren\u0027t} indifferent to these externals, making them your ultimate good or bad, you\u0027re clearly out of sync – that\u0027s sinning against the natural order. Nature uses these things impartially; they just happen as consequences of the original cosmic setup.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Better Dead Than Fake:} Best case: you leave this life without ever tasting lies, hypocrisy, excessive luxury, or arrogance. Second best: you die at least totally sick of that crap. Still choose to hang out with wickedness? Hasn\u0027t experience taught you \\textit{anything}? Flee this plague! A corrupted mind is way worse than any physical disease. Physical sickness messes with animals; mental sickness messes with \\textit{humans}.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Accept Death Like Puberty:} Don\u0027t disrespect death, but don\u0027t cling to life either. Be cool with it. It\u0027s just another natural process, like growing up, getting old, having kids. Teeth, beard, gray hair, birth, life – dissolution is part of the same cycle. A rational person waits for it calmly, like waiting for a baby to be born. It\u0027s just your soul dropping out of its current shell.\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{Everyday Comfort with Death:} Want a trick to make peace with dying? Focus on what you\u0027ll be \\textit{leaving behind} – specifically, the annoying, flawed characters your soul won\u0027t have to deal with anymore! Don\u0027t be mad at them, actually try to care for them and be patient, but remember: your release isn\u0027t from people who think just like you (that might actually make you want to stay). No, the \\textit{real} burden is the constant friction with people who \\textit{don\u0027t} get it. Seeing that makes you think: \"Come on, death, hurry up before I lose my own damn mind dealing with this!\"\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Wrongdoing Hurts the Doer:} Whoever acts wrongly, harms themselves. Whoever is unjust, does it \\textit{to themselves}, making themselves worse.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Injustice by Not Acting:} Often, injustice isn\u0027t just doing something wrong, but \\textit{failing} to do something right when you should have. Omission counts.\n\n\\item \\textbf{The Only Things You Need:} What\u0027s sufficient? 1) Your present judgment grasping reality accurately. 2) Your present action being socially helpful. 3) Your present attitude being okay with whatever external events happen. That’s it.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Mental Quick-Clean:} Wipe out imagination. Stop raw impulse. Kill clingy desire. Keep your core self in control.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Shared Resources:} Animals share one basic life force (vital spirit). Rational creatures share one mind-force (intelligence). Just like we all share one earth, see by one light, breathe one air (if we have sight and breath).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Like Attracts Like (Especially Minds):} Everything gravitates towards its own kind. Earth to earth, water to water, air clumps together (needs force to separate). Fire rises to join cosmic fire, easily igniting dry stuff here because it wants to connect. Things sharing the \\textit{same mind-stuff} rush together even faster and more eagerly because mind is superior.\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{Even Animals Get It:} Look at bees, herds, birds caring for young – even basic critters show unity. Higher up, you get communities, friendships, families, treaties. Higher still, even separate things like stars show a kind of cosmic unity. Progress towards higher states creates connection even across distance.\n        \\item \\textbf{Humans Forget:} Notice what\u0027s happening now? Only intelligent creatures seem to have forgotten this natural pull towards each other. Only here do you see a lack of connection. But even then, Nature\u0027s too strong – they \\textit{still} get pulled together despite themselves. Watch closely, you\u0027ll see it. It\u0027s easier to find dirt not sticking to dirt than a human totally cut off from other humans.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Everything Bears Fruit (Even Reason):} People, Gods, the Universe – they all produce results in their own season. We usually talk about \u0027fruit\u0027 for vines, etc., but that\u0027s just habit. Reason also bears fruit – for the whole system and for itself. And from Reason, other good things like it arise.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Teach or Tolerate (Again):} If you can, teach the person who\u0027s wrong. If you can\u0027t, remember kindness is your tool for this situation. Even the gods are kind to flawed people, helping them get stuff like health, wealth, reputation (they\u0027re that generous!). You can be too. Who\u0027s stopping you?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Work Without Drama:} Work hard, but not like a victim needing pity or applause. Have just one goal: to act or be still as rational, social reason requires.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Circumstance is Internal:} Today I got away from all bad circumstances. Actually, scratch that – I \\textit{threw them out}. Because they weren\u0027t \\textit{outside} me; they were \\textit{inside}, in my judgments about them.\n\n\\item \\textbf{It\u0027s All the Same Old Story:} Everything is the same pattern: familiar from experience, temporary in time, made of basic stuff. Everything now is just like it was in the time of the people we buried. Nothing new.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Things Don\u0027t Talk, Your Mind Does:} Stuff exists \u0027out there,\u0027 on its own. It doesn\u0027t know anything about itself or tell you anything. So what \\textit{does} report on it? Your own damn mind (governing self).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Good/Bad is in Action, Not Feeling:} For a thinking, social creature, good and bad aren\u0027t found in feelings, but in \\textit{actions}. Your virtue or vice shows up in what you \\textit{do}, not just how you feel.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Stone Thrown Up:} It\u0027s no evil for a stone to fall down, nor good for it to go up. It\u0027s just physics. (External events lack inherent moral value).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Look Inside Your Critics:} Penetrate into \\textit{their} minds (governing selves). You\u0027ll see what kind of judges you\u0027re actually afraid of... and how poorly they judge even themselves.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Everything Changes (Including You):} All things are in flux. You yourself are constantly changing, in a way constantly being destroyed and rebuilt. The whole universe is like that too.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Leave Their Crap With Them:} Another person\u0027s wrongdoing? You gotta leave it where it originated – with them. It\u0027s not your burden to carry internally.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Ending is Just Change, Not Evil:} Stopping an action, an impulse, a judgment – it\u0027s a pause, a kind of ending, but not an \\textit{evil}. Think about the phases of your life: childhood, youth, adulthood, old age. Each transition was an \u0027ending.\u0027 Was it scary? Now think about living under your grandfather, then mother, then father. See all those other endings and changes? Were \\textit{they} scary? So, the end, pause, or change of your \\textit{entire} life isn\u0027t inherently scary either.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Check Your Internal Compass (and Theirs):} Hurry to check in with: 1) Your own core self (make sure it\u0027s aiming for justice). 2) The core self of the Whole (remind yourself you\u0027re part of something bigger). 3) This other person\u0027s core self (try to see if they\u0027re acting from ignorance or intention, and remember their core self is fundamentally like yours).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Be a Team Player, Not a Rogue Cell:} You\u0027re a component of the social system. So, every action you take should contribute to that social system\u0027s health. Any act not aimed, directly or indirectly, at the common good rips your life apart, stops it from being unified, makes you a factionalist – like someone in a country working only for their tiny subgroup, disrupting the overall harmony.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Life\u0027s Vivid (Sometimes Creepy) Details:} Kids\u0027 tantrums, playing with dolls, maybe even those creepy ancient stories about spirits carrying corpses – sometimes vivid, even dark imagery (like visiting the underworld in myths) makes things hit home more strongly. (Acknowledge the sometimes harsh or strange realities).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Analyze Cause \\\u0026 Time:} Dig down to the specific cause of something. Separate it from the raw material involved. Then figure out the maximum time that specific cause or thing could naturally last.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Stop Troubling Yourself:} You suffer tons of problems because you aren\u0027t content just letting your core self do what it was designed to do. Enough already! Let it function properly.\n\n\\item \\textbf{See Their Inner Selves, Be Kind:} When someone blames you, hates you, or talks crap, go inside \\textit{their} inner selves. Penetrate their minds and see what kind of people they \\textit{really} are. You\u0027ll realize you shouldn\u0027t torture yourself worrying about their opinion. \\textit{However}, you still need to be genuinely well-disposed towards them. They are naturally your kin. Plus, the gods help them too (dreams, prophecies) to get the external stuff they\u0027re obsessed with.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Cosmic Cycles \\\u0026 Your Response:} The universe spins through the same cycles, up and down, age after age. Now, either the Mind of the Whole directs each individual thing (if so, accept its direction), OR it set things in motion once, and everything else follows logically (if so, why worry?). Whether the Whole is God (all good) or just random Chance (atoms mixing), don\u0027t let \\textit{yourself} be ruled by randomness.\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{Dust to Dust, Swiftly:} Soon enough, dirt covers us all. Then that dirt changes, and what comes next changes, forever and ever. Thinking about these constant waves of change, how fast mortal things pass, should make you hold them lightly, without excessive attachment.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Do Your Part, Forget Utopia \\\u0026 Fame:} The universe is a rushing river carrying everything along. Okay, man, what\u0027s \\textit{your} role? Do what Nature needs \\textit{right now}. Get on with it, if you can, and don\u0027t look around seeking approval. Don\u0027t dream of some perfect utopia (Plato\u0027s Republic); just be content making one tiny step forward. Realize even that small step is significant. These politicians and self-proclaimed philosophers are mostly full of hot air. Who can actually change people\u0027s core beliefs? And without that change, what is there but slaves groaning and pretending to obey? Forget comparing yourself to Alexander, Philip, Demetrius. If they truly understood Nature\u0027s will and learned from her, fine, follow their example. But if they were just actors on a stage? Nobody sentenced \\textit{you} to imitate actors. The real work of philosophy is simple: integrity and self-respect. Don\u0027t let me get sidetracked by vanity.\n\n\\item \\textbf{View from Above (Again):} Look down (metaphorically) on the chaos: countless herds, rituals, journeys in storms and calm; all the different creatures being born, interacting, dying. Think about lives lived long ago, lives yet to be lived, lives in \u0027uncivilized\u0027 places. How many don\u0027t know your name? How many will forget it instantly? How many praising you now will soon blame you? Realize that memory, fame, \\textit{anything} external is ultimately not worth obsessing over.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Your Two Duties: Calm Acceptance \\\u0026 Just Action:} Calmness about things that happen \\textit{from outside} you. Justice in things you \\textit{do} yourself. That means your impulses and actions should end simply in helping others, because that \\textit{is} acting according to your (social) nature.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Create Inner Space:} You can strip away tons of unnecessary baggage that\u0027s troubling you – it exists entirely \\textit{in your judgment}. Do that, and you\u0027ll instantly create huge mental space for yourself by: 1) Taking in the whole Universe in your thoughts. 2) Grasping the vastness of eternal Time. 3) Pondering the rapid changes in every single object – how short the time from birth to death, how huge the void before and after.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Everyone Ends Up Equal (Dead):} Everything you see will vanish quickly. And the people who saw it vanish? They\u0027ll vanish quickly too. The person who dies super old ends up in the same state as the baby who died prematurely. Time levels everyone.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Look at Their Naked Souls:} What are their core minds (governing selves) like? What cheap goals do they chase? For what petty reasons do they love or respect things? Get used to seeing their souls stripped bare. When they think their blame hurts or their praise helps, how incredibly vain they are.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Change Isn\u0027t Loss, It\u0027s Nature\u0027s Way:} \u0027Loss\u0027 is just another word for \u0027change.\u0027 And Universal Nature \\textit{rejoices} in change; it\u0027s how everything good happens. Things have always happened this way, and they always will, in similar forms. So why whine that \u0027everything\u0027s always been bad and always will be\u0027? You think the gods are powerless to fix things, that the world is doomed to endless evils? Seriously?\n\n\\item \\textbf{The Grimy Underside of Everything:} Think about the raw material: Water, dust, bones, stench. Marble? Just dirt crust. Gold/silver? Sediment. Clothes? Animal hair. Purple dye? Shellfish blood. Your breath? Just air, changing. It\u0027s all basic stuff, constantly transforming.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Enough Whining, Get Simple:} Enough of this miserable life, the complaining, the play-acting. Why are you upset? What\u0027s so new here? What\u0027s throwing you off? The \\textit{form} of things? Look it straight on. The \\textit{material}? Face that too. Besides these, there\u0027s nothing else. It\u0027s late in the game – just aim to become simpler and better in your relationship with reality/gods. Learning this stuff for 100 years or 3 years – it\u0027s the same lesson.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Maybe They Didn\u0027t Wrong You:} If someone did wrong, the harm is with \\textit{them}. But hold on – maybe they \\textit{didn\u0027t} actually do wrong (from their perspective, or maybe you misunderstood).\n\n\\item \\textbf{One Source or Random Atoms? Doesn\u0027t Matter for Your Response:} Either everything flows from one Mind (like a body), and the part shouldn\u0027t complain about what serves the whole; OR it\u0027s just atoms, mixing and scattering randomly. Either way, why be troubled? Tell your core self: \"Are you dead? Decayed? Turned animal? Just acting? Part of the herd? Just grazing?\" (i.e., Are you letting yourself be less than rational?).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Pray for Strength, Not Stuff:} The gods are either powerless or powerful. If powerless, why pray? If powerful, why not pray for the strength \\textit{not} to fear external things, \\textit{not} to desire them, \\textit{not} to grieve over them, rather than praying for them to be present or absent? Surely, if they can help humans, they can help with \\textit{this}. Maybe you\u0027ll say, \"But the gods put these things (externals) in my power.\" Okay, isn\u0027t it better to use what \\textit{is} in your power freely, instead of desperately craving what \\textit{isn\u0027t}, like a slave? Besides, who told you the gods \\textit{don\u0027t} help with things in our power too? Start praying about \\textit{these} internal strengths, and see what happens. That guy prays: \"How can I sleep with her?\" You pray: \"How can I \\textit{not desire} to sleep with her?\" Another prays: \"How can I get rid of him?\" You pray: \"How can I \\textit{not want} to be rid of him?\" Another: \"How can I not lose my child?\" You pray: \"How can I \\textit{not be afraid} to lose him?\" Flip your prayers around this way. See the difference.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Epicurus on Handling Sickness (Focus Inward):} Epicurus said: \"When I was sick, I didn\u0027t talk about my body\u0027s pains. I didn\u0027t drone on about that stuff to visitors. I kept debating key scientific principles, focusing only on how the mind, even aware of bodily chaos, can stay undisturbed and protect its own good. I didn\u0027t let the doctors act all high and mighty either. My life went on happily.\" Do the same. Sick? Injured? Whatever? Don\u0027t abandon your philosophy. Don\u0027t gossip with ignorant people. Focus only on the task at hand and the tools (your reason) you have to do it.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Expect Shamelessness, Use Your Antidote:} Offended by someone\u0027s shameless behavior? Ask yourself immediately: \"Is it possible for shameless people \\textit{not} to exist in the world?\" No, it\u0027s not. So don\u0027t demand the impossible. This person is just one of those shameless types that are bound to exist. Have the same thought ready for rogues, traitors, every kind of wrongdoer. Reminding yourself that this \\textit{type} of person inevitably exists makes you gentler towards the \\textit{individual}.\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{Nature Gave You Tools:} Remember the virtues Nature gave you to counter these flaws: mildness against the unfeeling, other tools for other wrongs. You generally \\textit{can} try to help someone who\u0027s gone astray (because wrongdoing \\textit{is} missing the mark).\n        \\item \\textbf{What Harm \\textit{Really} Done?:} Seriously, what harm have you suffered? You\u0027ll find none of these people you\u0027re mad at have done anything that actually made \\textit{your understanding} worse. And that\u0027s where your real harm or good resides.\n        \\item \\textbf{Maybe Blame Yourself for Surprise:} Is it really evil or strange that an untrained person acts like an untrained person? Maybe check yourself: shouldn\u0027t you have expected this? Reason gave you the tools to predict this probability, but you forgot and now you\u0027re shocked?\n        \\item \\textbf{Turn Inward on Blame (Especially Gratitude):} Most importantly, when blaming a traitor or ungrateful person, look inside yourself. The fault might be yours: did you trust someone untrustworthy? Or when you did a favor, did you do it with strings attached, not purely, not getting the \\textit{full} reward from the \\textit{act itself} right then and there? Because when you\u0027ve done good, what more do you want? Isn\u0027t acting according to your nature enough? Do you need payment for being you? Does the eye demand thanks for seeing, or feet for walking? They were made for that, they do their job, they get their reward intrinsically. Humans are made for benevolence. When you act kindly, you\u0027re doing what you were built for, and you get what\u0027s yours – the satisfaction of acting virtuously.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Tenth Gift (From the Muse Leader):} It\u0027s madness to expect bad people \\textit{not} to do wrong – that\u0027s demanding the impossible. But allowing them to be bad towards others while demanding they \\textit{never} wrong \\textit{you}? That\u0027s just being callous and tyrannical.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section*{BOOK X: MEDITATIONS BOOK X - THE BRO VERSION}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Soul Check-In: Are You Ready to Be Real?} Yo, Soul! When are you gonna finally be good, simple, straightforward, totally transparent, clearer than the body wrapped around you? When will you actually \\textit{feel} loving and devoted? When will you be truly satisfied, needing nothing, craving nothing – no thing, no person, no pleasure hit? Not needing more time for fun, not needing the perfect location or weather or crowd? Will you just be cool with \\textit{now}, pleased with \\textit{this moment}, trusting that whatever the gods/universe sends is for you, is good, and is part of sustaining the whole perfect system – the good, just, beautiful reality that creates, supports, includes, and recycles everything? Will you finally just \\textit{be} the kind of being that can hang with gods and humans without constantly finding fault or being judged yourself?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Know Your Needs (Body, Animal, Human):} First, figure out what your basic physical nature needs just to function. Do that, accept it, \\textit{unless} it makes your \u0027animal\u0027 nature worse (e.g., unhealthy addictions). Next, figure out what your \u0027animal\u0027 nature (instincts, drives) needs. Take that on board too, \\textit{unless} it makes your \u0027rational human\u0027 nature worse. Crucially, what\u0027s truly \\textit{rational} is also \\textit{social}. Use these rules, and stop stressing about everything else.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Handle It or It Handles You:} Anything that happens, you can either naturally handle it or you can\u0027t. If you \\textit{can} handle it, don\u0027t bitch – just handle it, that\u0027s what your nature is for. If you \\textit{can\u0027t} naturally handle it, don\u0027t bitch either – because it\u0027ll take you out fast anyway. But remember this key trick: you can handle almost \\textit{anything} if your own judgment makes it tolerable by telling yourself, \"Doing this is beneficial\" or \"This is my duty.\" Frame it right.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Correct Kindly or Check Yourself:} Someone screws up? Gently instruct them, point out what they missed. If that doesn\u0027t work, blame yourself (for expecting better, maybe?), or better yet, blame nobody. Just move on.\n\n\\item \\textbf{It Was Always Coming:} Whatever happens to you was set up for you from the beginning of time. The chain of causes spinning since eternity included both your existence and \\textit{this specific event} happening to you. It\u0027s baked into the system.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Atoms or Nature? Either Way, Be Part of the Team:} Whether it\u0027s random atoms or an ordered Nature, start with this: 1) I\u0027m part of the Whole, governed by Nature. 2) I\u0027m connected to other parts like me. Remember these? Then, as a part, you won\u0027t resent what the Whole assigns, because what helps the Whole can\u0027t hurt the part (the Whole doesn\u0027t harm itself, and no outside force \\textit{can} harm it).\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{Flow Smoothly:} Because I remember I\u0027m part of this system and connected to others like me, I\u0027ll act socially, aim for the common good, and steer clear of anything that hurts the team. Do things this way, and life flows smoothly – just like a good citizen\u0027s life flows smoothly when they help fellow citizens and accept what the city assigns.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{\u0027Perishing\u0027 \u003d Changing (It\u0027s Not Bad for the Whole):} The parts of the Whole (everything in the Universe) must \"perish\" – which just means \\textit{change}. If this necessary change were actually \\textit{evil} for the parts, the Whole couldn\u0027t function properly. Did Nature \\textit{plan} to injure its own parts, design them to fail? Or did bad stuff just happen without its knowledge? Neither makes sense.\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{Don\u0027t Whine About Natural Law:} Even if you ditch \"Nature\" and just talk \"natural laws,\" it\u0027s absurd to say parts change by natural law, then get shocked or mad when they \\textit{do}, especially when things just break down into their basic components. Atoms scatter, solids turn to earth, breath to air – it all gets reabsorbed by the universal Reason, whether through cosmic cycles or constant exchange.\n        \\item \\textbf{You Aren\u0027t Your Baby Body:} And don\u0027t think your current body and breath are the \\textit{exact} same ones you started with. You\u0027ve been taking in new material (food, air) constantly. What\u0027s changing is the stuff you \\textit{took in}. Even if this changing stuff feels intimately \"you,\" it doesn\u0027t wreck the core argument about change being natural.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Earn Your Titles, Stay True:} Give yourself these titles: Good, Respectful, True, Sane (rational/attentive), Conforming (accepting fate), High-Minded (mind over body/fame/death). Guard them. If you lose them, get back to them fast.\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{Definitions:} \u0027Sane\u0027 means paying close attention, not being sloppy. \u0027Conforming\u0027 means gladly accepting what Nature assigns. \u0027High-Minded\u0027 means your thinking part is above the body\u0027s ups and downs, petty reputation, death, and all that neutral stuff.\n        \\item \\textbf{Live the Titles or Bail:} Stick to these titles (not for others\u0027 praise, but for yourself), and you\u0027ll transform your life. Keep being torn and messed up like before? That\u0027s just animalistic, clinging to life like a wounded gladiator begging for one more day just to face the same claws tomorrow.\n        \\item \\textbf{Commit or Retreat:} Try hard for these titles. If you can hold them, great – live like you\u0027re on the Isles of the Blest. If you feel yourself slipping, retreat bravely to a quiet corner to regain control. Or, if needed, leave life altogether – not angrily, but simply, freely, with self-respect. Having made \\textit{that} exit right is at least one solid accomplishment.\n        \\item \\textbf{Remember the Gods (as Role Models):} Remembering the gods helps keep these titles in mind. They don\u0027t want flattery; they want rational beings to become like them. They want the fig tree to do fig-tree work, the dog dog work, the bee bee work, and the human \\textit{human} work.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Life\u0027s Distractions vs. Real Practice:} Play-acting, pointless conflicts, hyper-excitement, lazy apathy – it\u0027s all just forms of slavery! Every day, your sacred principles get wiped out if you don\u0027t actively apply them. You need to look at every situation, every action, and simultaneously: 1) Get the practical task done. 2) Exercise your philosophical understanding. 3) Maintain that quiet confidence that comes from \\textit{knowing} things scientifically, without showing off. When will you just enjoy being simple? Being dignified? Knowing the true nature of things, their place, lifespan, composition, ownership, who gives and takes?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Predators, Big and Small:} A spider feels proud catching a fly. A guy feels proud trapping a rabbit, catching a tiny fish, hunting boars or bears, or taking Sarmatian prisoners. Examine their mindset – aren\u0027t they all just bandits on different scales? (Critique of pride in external \u0027conquests\u0027).\n\n\\item \\textbf{Master the Science of Change:} Get a methodical grip on how \\textit{everything} changes into everything else. Constantly focus on this aspect of Nature, practice thinking about it. Nothing elevates the mind more. Someone who gets this has already shed their attachment to the body. Realizing they\u0027ll soon leave everything and everyone behind, they dedicate themselves completely: to justice in their \\textit{own} actions, and to accepting Universal Nature in everything else. They stop caring what others say, think, or do against them. Content with two things: acting justly \\textit{now}, and embracing what\u0027s assigned \\textit{now}. They ditch all distractions and ambitions, wanting only to follow the straight path of law, following God/Nature\u0027s lead.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Act on Reason, or Get Advice:} Why wait for a hint when you can \\textit{see} what needs doing? If you see it, just do it kindly, without looking back. If you \\textit{don\u0027t} see it clearly, pause. Get advice from the best people available. If other issues block \\textit{that*, move forward cautiously with the opportunities you *do* have, sticking firmly to what seems just. Achieving justice is the best outcome; failure means failing at \\textit{that}. Follow Reason in everything, and you\u0027ll be efficient, quick, cheerful, and composed all at once.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Whose Opinion Matters at 3 AM?:} Ask yourself the second you wake up: Does it really matter if someone else blames my just and right actions? Hell no. Have you forgotten what these people who puff themselves up over praise or blame are \\textit{really} like? Their habits, what they chase, avoid, how they steal and scheme (not with hands, but with their minds – that precious part where faith, respect, truth, law, and goodness \\textit{could} live, if they chose)?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Give and Take with Nature:} To Nature, the giver and taker of all things, the educated and self-respecting person says: \"Give what you please, take back what you please.\" They say this not arrogantly, but simply listening to her, being in sync with her.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Live True, Even if Alone:} This little bit of life left? Live it like you\u0027re on a mountaintop. Where you are physically doesn\u0027t matter if you live \\textit{in the Universe} as your true city. Let people see a \\textit{real} person, living in tune with Nature. If they can\u0027t handle it? Let them kill you. Better that than living on \\textit{their} compromised terms.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Stop Talking, Start Being:} Don\u0027t just endlessly discuss what a good person is like. \\textit{Be} one.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Cosmic Scale Check:} Constantly picture the whole of Time and the whole of Substance. Realize that individual things are like a fig-seed compared to Substance, and a single moment is like one turn of a drill compared to Time. Keep perspective.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Everything is Dissolving Now:} Focus on anything that exists and reflect: it\u0027s \\textit{already} breaking down, changing, decaying, scattering. In a sense, it\u0027s \"born to die.\" See the process happening.\n\n\\item \\textbf{The Animal Cycle \\\u0026 Petty Rule:} Look at them: eating, sleeping, screwing, shitting. Basic animal stuff. Then look at them as rulers: bossy, angry, finding fault constantly. Yet yesterday they were slaves to so many desires and masters! And tomorrow they\u0027ll be back in some similar state. Humans!\n\n\\item \\textbf{Nature\u0027s Gifts Are Timely:} What benefits each person is what Universal Nature brings them, and it\u0027s beneficial \\textit{precisely when} she brings it. Trust the timing.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Loving What Happens:} \"Earth loves the rain,\" \"the sky loves to rain.\" The Universe itself \\textit{loves} to create what\u0027s next. So, I say to the Universe: \"I love what you love.\" Isn\u0027t that what \"This loves to happen\" really means? Align your will with reality.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Your Options: Live, Leave, or Die:} You either: 1) Keep living here, familiar with the game. 2) Choose to leave (suicide, though implied gently). 3) Die naturally, your service complete. Those are the only options. So, have courage.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Retreat is Anywhere (It\u0027s Internal):} Always remember Plato\u0027s point: any place of retreat is like any other. What matters is your inner state. Being on a mountaintop, by the sea, or stuck in the city – it\u0027s all the same if your mind is right. You can build your mental \u0027sheepfold on a hill\u0027 anywhere.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Mind Check: Healthy or Compromised?:} What is my core self (governing reason) doing \\textit{for me} right now? What am I making it into? What am I using it for? Is it lacking reason? Is it cut off from society? Is it so blended with the body\u0027s urges that it just follows them blindly?\n\n\\item \\textbf{Fugitive Slaves (Against Law/Nature):} Running from your master makes you a fugitive slave. Law/Nature is the ultimate master. Break its rules? Fugitive. Give in to sorrow, anger, fear? You\u0027re wishing things weren\u0027t as they were ordained by the master planner (Law/Nature). That\u0027s being a fugitive from reality.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Hidden Power of Creation \\\u0026 Growth:} A man plants a seed, walks away. Another causal principle takes over, works on it, completes a baby. Amazing result from a tiny start! Then the baby eats, another principle takes over, creates senses, impulses, life, strength – so many marvels! Contemplate these hidden processes. See the power, like gravity – invisible but undeniable.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Same Plays, Different Actors:} Constantly reflect how things happening today are just like things that happened long ago, and they\u0027ll happen again. Picture whole dramas, scenes you know from your life or history: Hadrian\u0027s court, Antoninus\u0027s court, Philip, Alexander, Croesus – all the same basic human stories, just with different actors.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Don\u0027t Be the Squealing Pig:} Picture anyone giving in to pain or discontent as like a pig being sacrificed – kicking and squealing. Or like someone groaning alone on their sickbed. Remember the chain of necessity we\u0027re bound by. Only rational creatures get the \\textit{choice} to follow willingly. Everyone else just gets dragged along. Choose willing obedience.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Death Check on Actions:} With each separate action, stop and ask: \"Is death scary because it means I\u0027m deprived of \\textit{this specific thing}?\" (Usually puts things in perspective).\n\n\\item \\textbf{See Your Own Similar Flaws:} When you bump into someone\u0027s bad behavior, immediately reflect: \"What similar mistake do \\textit{I} make?\" (e.g., treating money, pleasure, or fame as ultimate goods). Attend to this, and your anger will fade fast, especially when you realize they are likely \\textit{compelled} by their flawed judgments (what else \\textit{can} they do?). Or, if possible, remove the compulsion (teach them).\n\n\\item \\textbf{See Parallels, Realize Impermanence:} When you see certain types of people (Satyrion, Eutyches, etc.), picture their philosophical counterparts (Socrates, etc.). Look at yourself, picture a Caesar (or equivalent leader). Find parallels everywhere. Then let it hit you: \"Where are they \\textit{all} now?\" Nowhere, or unknown. This shows how human life is smoke, nothingness, especially since things change and won\u0027t exist again in infinite time. So why bother getting worked up? Why not just pass through this brief moment well-ordered? What situation are you really running from? Life is just an exercise school for reason. Wait patiently until you can digest \\textit{everything} like a strong stomach handles food, or a bright fire turns everything into flame and light.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Be Simple \\\u0026 Good, Or Don\u0027t Bother:} Let nobody truthfully say you aren\u0027t simple and good. Let anyone who thinks otherwise be a liar. This is entirely up to \\textit{you}. Who\u0027s stopping you from being good and simple? Just decide you won\u0027t keep living if you \\textit{can\u0027t} be that way. Reason itself rejects anything less.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Reason Can Go Anywhere:} What\u0027s the soundest thing to do or say in \\textit{this} situation? Whatever it is, you \\textit{can} do or say it. Don\u0027t make excuses about being prevented. You\u0027ll groan forever unless you feel that acting according to human nature, in \\textit{any} situation, is its own kind of \u0027luxury\u0027 (like pleasure is to the sensualist). Doing what aligns with your nature \\textit{is} indulgence. You can do it anywhere. A physical cylinder can\u0027t always roll; water, fire, etc., face obstacles. But Mind and Reason? They can move through \\textit{any} opposition, as their nature and their will dictates. See how easily Reason can navigate (like fire goes up, stones down, cylinders roll downhill)? Ask for nothing more. Other obstacles affect the body (which is lifeless without mind) or don\u0027t harm the core self without Reason\u0027s consent.\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item \\textbf{Obstacles Make You Better (If Used Right):} If obstacles \\textit{did} harm the core self, the person affected would become evil. But look – with other things, damage makes them worse. With humans using Reason? We can become \\textit{better}, more praiseworthy, by \\textit{using} circumstances correctly. Remember: nothing harms the citizen that doesn\u0027t harm the city (the social good), and nothing harms the city that doesn\u0027t harm the law (the rational order). None of these \u0027bad luck\u0027 events harm the law. Therefore, they don\u0027t harm the city or the citizen (in their core self).\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n\\item \\textbf{Reminders Against Fear (Like Leaves):} For someone bitten by true principles, even the shortest, most common saying is enough to banish grief and fear. Like Homer\u0027s line: \"Leaves, the wind scatters some... like them are the children of men.\" Yes, your kids are \u0027leaves.\u0027 Those shouting praise or blame are \u0027leaves.\u0027 Those who remember you later are \u0027leaves.\u0027 They all sprout in spring, wind blows them down, the forest grows new ones. Brief life is everyone\u0027s lot. Yet you chase and avoid things like they\u0027re forever. Soon, you\u0027ll close your eyes. And soon after, someone else will be mourning the person who carried \\textit{you} out.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Healthy Mind Accepts All Input:} A healthy eye sees everything, doesn\u0027t wish everything were green (like someone with jaundice). Healthy ears/nose take in all sounds/smells. A healthy stomach handles all food (like a mill grinds anything). So, a healthy \\textit{understanding* must be ready for \\textit{all circumstances}. The mind that says, \"Keep my kids safe!\" or \"Everyone praise me!\" is like the sick eye wanting only green, or weak teeth wanting only soft food. It\u0027s demanding reality conform to its preference.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Nobody Dies Without Someone Glad (So Leave Kindly):} Nobody\u0027s so lucky that \\textit{everyone} is sad when they die. Someone\u0027s usually thinking, \"Good riddance.\" Even for a good, wise person, someone might think, \"Finally, we can relax without this teacher judging us silently.\" That\u0027s for the \\textit{good} ones! For the rest of us? Lots of reasons people might be glad we\u0027re gone. Think about this when you die, and you\u0027ll leave more easily: \"I\u0027m leaving a life where even the people I worked for, prayed for, thought about – even \\textit{they} want me gone, hoping for some relief.\" Why cling to staying longer? \\textit{But}, don\u0027t leave them unkindly because of this. Keep your character: friendly, well-disposed, forgiving. And don\u0027t go like you\u0027re being ripped away. Like a soul slipping easily from a body in a peaceful death, let your departure from them be smooth. Nature bound you to them; now she releases you. I\u0027m freed from my kin, but I don\u0027t resist, I\u0027m not forced. This release is also according to Nature.\n\n\\item \\textbf{Ask \"Why?\" (Start with Yourself):} Whenever someone does something, as much as possible, ask yourself: \"What\u0027s their underlying motive? What goal are they aiming for with this?\" And start this inquiry with \\textit{yourself}. Examine your own motives first.\n\n\\item \\textbf{You Are the Puppeteer Within:} Remember, the hidden thing inside you pulls the strings. \\textit{That} is the activity, the life, the \\textit{person}, so to speak. Don\u0027t get fixated on the body-vessel around you or the attached organs. They\u0027re just tools, like an axe, only attached. They\u0027re useless without the inner cause that moves or stops them – like a shuttle without a weaver, pen without a writer, whip without a driver.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{document}\n```",
