      "text": "I am doing \"bro versions\" of classic stoic texts. Check this first work and reproduce it with my new target.\n\noriginal : \n\nSaunders, Jason L., Justus Lipsius. The Philosophy of Renaissance Stoicism. New York, 1955.\nWenley, R. M., Stoicism and Its Influence. New York, 1927.\nTHE ENCHIRIDION\nI\nThere are things which are within our power, and there are things which are beyond our power. Within our power are opinion, aim, desire, aversion, and, in one word, whatever affairs are our own. Beyond our power are body, property, reputation, office, and, in one word, whatever are not properly our own affairs.\n\nNow the things within our power are by nature free, unrestricted, unhindered; but those beyond our power are weak, dependent, restricted, alien. Remember, then, that if you attribute freedom to things by nature dependent and take what belongs to others for your own, you will be hindered, you will lament, you will be disturbed, you will find fault both with gods and men. But if you take for your own only that which is your own and view what belongs to others just as it really is, then no one will ever compel you, no one will restrict you; you will find fault with no one, you will accuse no one, you will do nothing against your will; no one will hurt you, you will not have an enemy, nor will you suffer any harm.\n\nAiming, therefore, at such great things, remember that you must not allow yourself any inclination, however slight, toward the attainment of the others; but that you must entirely quit some of them, and for the present postpone the rest. But if you would have these, and possess power and wealth likewise, you may miss the latter in seeking the former; and you will certainly fail of that by which alone happiness and freedom are procured.\n\nSeek at once, therefore, to be able to say to every unpleasing semblance, “You are but a semblance and by no means the real thing.” And then examine it by those rules which you have; and first and chiefly by this: whether it concerns the things which are within our own power or those which are not; and if it concerns anything beyond our power, be prepared to say that it is nothing to you.\n\nII\nRemember that desire demands the attainment of that of which you are desirous; and aversion demands the avoidance of that to which you are averse; that he who fails of the object of his desires is disappointed; and he who incurs the object of his aversion is wretched. If, then, you shun only those undesirable things which you can control, you will never incur anything which you shun; but if you shun sickness, or death, or poverty, you will run the risk of wretchedness. Remove [the habit of] aversion, then, from all things that are not within our power, and apply it to things undesirable which are within our power. But for the present, altogether restrain desire; for if you desire any of the things not within our own power, you must necessarily be disappointed; and you are not yet secure of those which are within our power, and so are legitimate objects of desire. Where it is practically necessary for you to pursue or avoid anything, do even this with discretion and gentleness and moderation.\n\nIII\nWith regard to whatever objects either delight the mind or contribute to use or are tenderly beloved, remind yourself of what nature they are, beginning with the merest trifles: if you have a favorite cup, that it is but a cup of which you are fond of—for thus, if it is broken, you can bear it; if you embrace your child or your wife, that you embrace a mortal—and thus, if either of them dies, you can bear it.\n\nIV\nWhen you set about any action, remind yourself of what nature the action is. If you are going to bathe, represent to yourself the incidents usual in the bath—some persons pouring out, others pushing in, others scolding, others pilfering. And thus you will more safely go about this action if you say to yourself, “I will now go to bathe and keep my own will in harmony with nature.” And so with regard to every other action. For thus, if any impediment arises in bathing, you will be able to say, “It was not only to bathe that I desired, but to keep my will in harmony with nature; and I shall not keep it thus if I am out of humor at things that happen.”\n\nV\nMen are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things. Thus death is nothing terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror consists in our notion of death, that it is terrible. When, therefore, we are hindered or disturbed, or grieved, let us never impute it to others, but to ourselves—that is, to our own views. It is the action of an uninstructed person to reproach others for his own misfortunes; of one entering upon instruction, to reproach himself; and one perfectly instructed, to reproach neither others nor himself.\n\nVI\nBe not elated at any excellence not your own. If a horse should be elated, and say, “I am handsome,” it might be endurable. But when you are elated and say, “I have a handsome horse,” know that you are elated only on the merit of the horse. What then is your own? The use of the phenomena of existence. So that when you are in harmony with nature in this respect, you will be elated with some reason; for you will be elated at some good of your own.\n\nVII\nAs in a voyage, when the ship is at anchor, if you go on shore to get water, you may amuse yourself with picking up a shellfish or a truffle in your way, but your thoughts ought to be bent toward the ship, and perpetually attentive, lest the captain should call, and then you must leave all these things, that you may not have to be carried on board the vessel, bound like a sheep; thus likewise in life, if, instead of a truffle or shellfish, such a thing as a wife or a child be granted you, there is no objection; but if the captain calls, run to the ship, leave all these things, and never look behind. But if you are old, never go far from the ship, lest you should be missing when called for.\n\nVIII\nDemand not that events should happen as you wish; but wish them to happen as they do happen, and you will go on well.\n\nIX\nSickness is an impediment to the body, but not to the will unless itself pleases. Lameness is an impediment to the leg, but not to the will; and say this to yourself with regard to everything that happens. For you will find it to be an impediment to something else, but not truly to yourself.\n\nX\nUpon every accident, remember to turn toward yourself and inquire what faculty you have for its use. If you encounter a handsome person, you will find continence the faculty needed; if pain, then fortitude; if reviling, then patience. And when thus habituated, the phenomena of existence will not overwhelm you.\n\nXI\nNever say of anything, “I have lost it,” but, “I have restored it.” Has your child died? It is restored. Has your wife died? She is restored. Has your estate been taken away? That likewise is restored. “But it was a bad man who took it.” What is it to you by whose hands he who gave it has demanded it again? While he permits you to possess it, hold it as something not your own, as do travelers at an inn.\n\nXII\nIf you would improve, lay aside such reasonings as these: “If I neglect my affairs, I shall not have a maintenance; if I do not punish my servant, he will be good for nothing.” For it were better to die of hunger, exempt from grief and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better that your servant should be bad than you unhappy.\n\nBegin therefore with little things. Is a little oil spilled or a little wine stolen? Say to yourself, “This is the price paid for peace and tranquillity; and nothing is to be had for nothing.” And when you call your servant, consider that it is possible he may not come at your call; or, if he does, that he may not do what you wish. But it is not at all desirable for him, and very undesirable for you, that it should be in his power to cause you any disturbance.\n\nXIII\nIf you would improve, be content to be thought foolish and dull with regard to externals. Do not desire to be thought to know anything; and though you should appear to others to be somebody, distrust yourself. For be assured, it is not easy at once to keep your will in harmony with nature and to secure externals; but while you are absorbed in the one, you must of necessity neglect the other.\n\nXIV\nIf you wish your children and your wife and your friends to live forever, you are foolish, for you wish things to be in your power which are not so, and what belongs to others to be your own. So likewise, if you wish your servant to be without fault, you are foolish, for you wish vice not to be vice but something else. But if you wish not to be disappointed in your desires, that is in your own power. Exercise, therefore, what is in your power. A man’s master is he who is able to confer or remove whatever that man seeks or shuns. Whoever then would be free, let him wish nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on others; else he must necessarily be a slave.\n\nXV\nRemember that you must behave as at a banquet. Is anything brought round to you? Put out your hand and take a moderate share. Does it pass by you? Do not stop it. Is it not yet come? Do not yearn in desire toward it, but wait till it reaches you. So with regard to children, wife, office, riches; and you will some time or other be worthy to feast with the gods. And if you do not so much as take the things which are set before you, but are able even to forego them, then you will not only be worthy to feast with the gods, but to rule with them also. For, by thus doing, Diogenes and Heraclitus, and others like them, deservedly became divine, and were so recognized.\n\nXVI\nWhen you see anyone weeping for grief, either that his son has gone abroad or that he has suffered in his affairs, take care not to be overcome by the apparent evil, but discriminate and be ready to say, “What hurts this man is not this occurrence itself—for another man might not be hurt by it—but the view he chooses to take of it.” As far as conversation goes, however, do not disdain to accommodate yourself to him and, if need be, to groan with him. Take heed, however, not to groan inwardly, too.\n\nXVII\nRemember that you are an actor in a drama of such sort as the Author chooses—if short, then in a short one; if long, then in a long one. If it be his pleasure that you should enact a poor man, or a cripple, or a ruler, or a private citizen, see that you act it well. For this is your business—to act well the given part, but to choose it belongs to another.\n\nXVIII\nWhen a raven happens to croak unluckily, be not overcome by appearances, but discriminate and say, “Nothing is portended to me, either to my paltry body, or property, or reputation, or children, or wife. But to me all portents are lucky if I will. For whatsoever happens, it belongs to me to derive advantage therefrom.”\n\nXIX\nYou can be unconquerable if you enter into no combat in which it is not in your own power to conquer. When, therefore, you see anyone eminent in honors or power, or in high esteem on any other account, take heed not to be bewildered by appearances and to pronounce him happy; for if the essence of good consists in things within our own power, there will be no room for envy or emulation. But, for your part, do not desire to be a general, or a senator, or a consul, but to be free; and the only way to this is a disregard of things which lie not within our own power.\n\nXX\nRemember that it is not he who gives abuse or blows, who affronts, but the view we take of these things as insulting. When, therefore, anyone provokes you, be assured that it is your own opinion which provokes you. Try, therefore, in the first place, not to be bewildered by appearances. For if you once gain time and respite, you will more easily command yourself.\n\nXXI\nLet death and exile, and all other things which appear terrible, be daily before your eyes, but death chiefly; and you will never entertain an abject thought, nor too eagerly covet anything.\n\nXXII\nIf you have an earnest desire toward philosophy, prepare yourself from the very first to have the multitude laugh and sneer, and say, “He is returned to us a philosopher all at once”; and, “Whence this supercilious look?” Now, for your part, do not have a supercilious look indeed, but keep steadily to those things which appear best to you, as one appointed by God to this particular station. For remember that, if you are persistent, those very persons who at first ridiculed will afterwards admire you. But if you are conquered by them, you will incur a double ridicule.\n\nXXIII\nIf you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, for the pleasure of anyone, be assured that you have ruined your scheme of life. Be content, then, in everything, with being a philosopher; and if you wish to seem so likewise to anyone, appear so to yourself, and it will suffice you.\n\nXXIV\nLet not such considerations as these distress you: “I shall live in discredit and be nobody anywhere.” For if discredit be an evil, you can no more be involved in evil through another than in baseness. Is it any business of yours, then, to get power or to be admitted to an entertainment? By no means. How then, after all, is this discredit? And how it is true that you will be nobody anywhere when you ought to be somebody in those things only which are within your own power, in which you may be of the greatest consequence? “But my friends will be unassisted.” What do you mean by “unassisted”? They will not have money from you, nor will you make them Roman citizens. Who told you, then, that these are among the things within our own power, and not rather the affairs of others? And who can give to another the things which he himself has not? “Well, but get them, then, that we too may have a share.” If I can get them with the preservation of my own honor and fidelity and self-respect, show me the way and I will get them; but if you require me to lose my own proper good, that you may gain what is no good, consider how unreasonable and foolish you are. Besides, which would you rather have, a sum of money or a faithful and honorable friend? Rather assist me, then, to gain this character than require me to do those things by which I may lose it. Well, but my country, say you, as far as depends upon me, will be unassisted. Here, again, what assistance is this you mean? It will not have porticos nor baths of your providing? And what signifies that? Why, neither does a smith provide it with shoes, nor a shoemaker with arms. It is enough if everyone fully performs his own proper business. And were you to supply it with another faithful and honorable citizen, would not he be of use to it? Yes. Therefore neither are you yourself useless to it. “What place, then,” say you, “shall I hold in the state?” Whatever you can hold with the preservation of your fidelity and honor. But if, by desiring to be useful to that, you lose these, how can you serve your country when you have become faithless and shameless?\n\nXXV\nIs anyone preferred before you at an entertainment, or in courtesies, or in confidential intercourse? If these things are good, you ought to rejoice that he has them; and if they are evil, do not be grieved that you have them not. And remember that you cannot be permitted to rival others in externals without using the same means to obtain them. For how can he who will not haunt the door of any man, will not attend him, will not praise him, have an equal share with him who does these things? You are unjust, then, and unreasonable if you are unwilling to pay the price for which these things are sold, and would have them for nothing. For how much are lettuces sold? An obulus, for instance. If another, then, paying an obulus, takes the lettuces, and you, not paying it, go without them, do not imagine that he has gained any advantage over you. For as he has the lettuces, so you have the obulus which you did not give. So, in the present case, you have not been invited to such a person’s entertainment because you have not paid him the price for which a supper is sold. It is sold for praise; it is sold for attendance. Give him, then, the value if it be for your advantage. But if you would at the same time not pay the one, and yet receive the other, you are unreasonable and foolish. Have you nothing, then, in place of the supper? Yes, indeed, you have—not to praise him whom you do not like to praise; not to bear the insolence of his lackeys.\n\nXXVI\nThe will of nature may be learned from things upon which we are all agreed. As when our neighbor’s boy has broken a cup, or the like, we are ready at once to say, “These are casualties that will happen”; be assured, then, that when your own cup is likewise broken, you ought to be affected just as when another’s cup was broken. Now apply this to greater things. Is the child or wife of another dead? There is no one who would not say, “This is an accident of mortality.” But if anyone’s own child happens to die, it is immediately, “Alas! how wretched am I!” It should be always remembered how we are affected on hearing the same thing concerning others.\n\nXXVII\nAs a mark[1] is not set up for the sake of missing the aim, so neither does the nature of evil exist in the world.\n\nXXVIII\nIf a person had delivered up your body to some passer-by, you would certainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in delivering up your own mind to any reviler, to be disconcerted and confounded?\n\nXXIX[2]\nIn every affair consider what precedes and what follows, and then undertake it. Otherwise you will begin with spirit, indeed, careless of the consequences, and when these are developed, you will shamefully desist. “I would conquer at the Olympic Games.” But consider what precedes and what follows, and then, if it be for your advantage, engage in the affair. You must conform to rules, submit to a diet, refrain from dainties; exercise your body, whether you choose it or not, at a stated hour, in heat and cold; you must drink no cold water, and sometimes no wine—in a word, you must give yourself up to your trainer as to a physician. Then, in the combat, you may be thrown into a ditch, dislocate your arm, turn your ankle, swallow an abundance of dust, receive stripes [for negligence], and, after all, lose the victory. When you have reckoned up all this, if your inclination still holds, set about the combat. Otherwise, take notice, you will behave like children who sometimes play wrestlers, sometimes gladiators, sometimes blow a trumpet, and sometimes act a tragedy, when they happen to have seen and admired these shows. Thus you too will be at one time a wrestler, and another a gladiator; now a philosopher, now an orator; but nothing in earnest. Like an ape you mimic all you see, and one thing after another is sure to please you, but is out of favor as soon as it becomes familiar. For you have never entered upon anything considerately; nor after having surveyed and tested the whole matter, but carelessly, and with a halfway zeal. Thus some, when they have seen a philosopher and heard a man speaking like Euphrates[3]—though, indeed, who can speak like him?—have a mind to be philosophers, too. Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do you think that you can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob.\n\nXXX\nDuties are universally measured by relations. Is a certain man your father? In this are implied taking care of him, submitting to him in all things, patiently receiving his reproaches, his correction. But he is a bad father. Is your natural tie, then, to a good father? No, but to a father. Is a brother unjust? Well, preserve your own just relation toward him. Consider not what he does, but what you are to do to keep your own will in a state conformable to nature, for another cannot hurt you unless you please. You will then be hurt when you consent to be hurt. In this manner, therefore, if you accustom yourself to contemplate the relations of neighbor, citizen, commander, you can deduce from each the corresponding duties.\n\nXXXI\nBe assured that the essence of piety toward the gods lies in this—to form right opinions concerning them, as existing and as governing the universe justly and well. And fix yourself in this resolution, to obey them, and yield to them, and willingly follow them amidst all events, as being ruled by the most perfect wisdom. For thus you will never find fault with the gods, nor accuse them of neglecting you. And it is not possible for this to be affected in any other way than by withdrawing yourself from things which are not within our own power, and by making good or evil to consist only in those which are. For if you suppose any other things to be either good or evil, it is inevitable that, when you are disappointed of what you wish or incur what you would avoid, you should reproach and blame their authors. For every creature is naturally formed to flee and abhor things that appear hurtful and that which causes them; and to pursue and admire those which appear beneficial and that which causes them. It is impracticable, then, that one who supposes himself to be hurt should rejoice in the person who, as he thinks, hurts him, just as it is impossible to rejoice in the hurt itself. Hence, also, a father is reviled by his son when he does not impart the things which seem to be good; and this made Polynices and Eteocles[4] mutually enemies—that empire seemed good to both. On this account the husbandman reviles the gods; [and so do] the sailor, the merchant, or those who have lost wife or child. For where our interest is, there, too, is piety directed. So that whoever is careful to regulate his desires and aversions as he ought is thus made careful of piety likewise. But it also becomes incumbent on everyone to offer libations and sacrifices and first fruits, according to the customs of his country, purely, and not heedlessly nor negligently; not avariciously, nor yet extravagantly.\n\nXXXII\nWhen you have recourse to divination, remember that you know not what the event will be, and you come to learn it of the diviner; but of what nature it is you knew before coming; at least, if you are of philosophic mind. For if it is among the things not within our own power, it can by no means be either good or evil. Do not, therefore, bring with you to the diviner either desire or aversion—else you will approach him trembling—but first clearly understand that every event is indifferent and nothing to you, of whatever sort it may be; for it will be in your power to make a right use of it, and this no one can hinder. Then come with confidence to the gods as your counselors; and afterwards, when any counsel is given you, remember what counselors you have assumed, and whose advice you will neglect if you disobey. Come to divination as Socrates prescribed, in cases of which the whole consideration relates to the event, and in which no opportunities are afforded by reason or any other art to discover the matter in view. When, therefore, it is our duty to share the danger of a friend or of our country, we ought not to consult the oracle as to whether we shall share it with them or not. For though the diviner should forewarn you that the auspices are unfavorable, this means no more than that either death or mutilation or exile is portended. But we have reason within us; and it directs us, even with these hazards, to stand by our friend and our country. Attend, therefore, to the greater diviner, the Pythian God, who once cast out of the temple him who neglected to save his friend.[5]\n\nXXXIII\nBegin by prescribing to yourself some character and demeanor, such as you may preserve both alone and in company.\n\nBe mostly silent, or speak merely what is needful, and in few words. We may, however, enter sparingly into discourse sometimes, when occasion calls for it; but let it not run on any of the common subjects, as gladiators, or horse races, or athletic champions, or food, or drink—the vulgar topics of conversation—and especially not on men, so as either to blame, or praise, or make comparisons. If you are able, then, by your own conversation, bring over that of your company to proper subjects; but if you happen to find yourself among strangers, be silent.\n\nLet not your laughter be loud, frequent, or abundant.\n\nAvoid taking oaths, if possible, altogether; at any rate, so far as you are able.\n\nAvoid public and vulgar entertainments; but if ever an occasion calls you to them, keep your attention upon the stretch, that you may not imperceptibly slide into vulgarity. For be assured that if a person be ever so pure himself, yet, if his companion be corrupted, he who converses with him will be corrupted likewise.\n\nProvide things relating to the body no further than absolute need requires, as meat, drink, clothing, house, retinue. But cut off everything that looks toward show and luxury.\n\nBefore marriage guard yourself with all your ability from unlawful intercourse with women; yet be not uncharitable or severe to those who are led into this, nor boast frequently that you yourself do otherwise.\n\nIf anyone tells you that a certain person speaks ill of you, do not make excuses about what is said of you, but answer: “He was ignorant of my other faults, else he would not have mentioned these alone.”\n\nIt is not necessary for you to appear often at public spectacles; but if ever there is a proper occasion for you to be there, do not appear more solicitous for any other than for yourself—that is, wish things to be only just as they are, and only the best man to win; for thus nothing will go against you. But abstain entirely from acclamations and derision and violent emotions. And when you come away, do not discourse a great deal on what has passed and what contributes nothing to your own amendment. For it would appear by such discourse that you were dazzled by the show.\n\nBe not prompt or ready to attend private recitations; but if you do attend, preserve your gravity and dignity, and yet avoid making yourself disagreeable.\n\nWhen you are going to confer with anyone, and especially with one who seems your superior, represent to yourself how Socrates or Zeno[6] would behave in such a case, and you will not be at a loss to meet properly whatever may occur.\n\nWhen you are going before anyone in power, fancy to yourself that you may not find him at home, that you may be shut out, that the doors may not be opened to you, that he may not notice you. If, with all this, it be your duty to go, bear what happens and never say to yourself, “It was not worth so much”; for this is vulgar, and like a man bewildered by externals.\n\nIn company, avoid a frequent and excessive mention of your own actions and dangers. For however agreeable it may be to yourself to allude to the risks you have run, it is not equally agreeable to others to hear your adventures. Avoid likewise an endeavor to excite laughter, for this may readily slide you into vulgarity, and, besides, may be apt to lower you in the esteem of your acquaintance. Approaches to indecent discourse are likewise dangerous. Therefore, when anything of this sort happens, use the first fit opportunity to rebuke him who makes advances that way, or, at least, by silence and blushing and a serious look show yourself to be displeased by such talk.\n\nXXXIV\nIf you are dazzled by the semblance of any promised pleasure, guard yourself against being bewildered by it; but let the affair wait your leisure, and procure yourself some delay. Then bring to your mind both points of time—that in which you shall enjoy the pleasure, and that in which you will repent and reproach yourself, after you have enjoyed it—and set before you, in opposition to these, how you will rejoice and applaud yourself if you abstain. And even though it should appear to you a seasonable gratification, take heed that its enticements and allurements and seductions may not subdue you, but set in opposition to this how much better it is to be conscious of having gained so great a victory.\n\nXXXV\nWhen you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought to be done, never shrink from being seen to do it, even though the world should misunderstand it; for if you are not acting rightly, shun the action itself; if you are, why fear those who wrongly censure you?\n\nXXXVI\nAs the proposition, “either it is day or it is night,” has much force in a disjunctive argument, but none at all in a conjunctive one, so, at a feast, to choose the largest share is very suitable to the bodily appetite, but utterly inconsistent with the social spirit of the entertainment. Remember, then, when you eat with another, not only the value to the body of those things which are set before you, but also the value of proper courtesy toward your host.\n\nXXXVII\nIf you have assumed any character beyond your strength, you have both demeaned yourself ill in that and quitted one which you might have supported.\n\nXXXVIII\nAs in walking you take care not to tread upon a nail, or turn your foot, so likewise take care not to hurt the ruling faculty of your mind. And if we were to guard against this in every action, we should enter upon action more safely.\n\nXXXIX\nThe body is to everyone the proper measure of its possessions, as the foot is of the shoe. If, therefore, you stop at this, you will keep the measure; but if you move beyond it, you must necessarily be carried forward, as down a precipice; as in the case of a shoe, if you go beyond its fitness to the foot, it comes first to be gilded, then purple, and then studded with jewels. For to that which once exceeds the fit measure there is no bound.\n\nXL\nWomen from fourteen years old are flattered by men with the title of mistresses. Therefore, perceiving that they are regarded only as qualified to give men pleasure, they begin to adorn themselves, and in that to place all their hopes. It is worth while, therefore, to try that they may perceive themselves honored only so far as they appear beautiful in their demeanor and modestly virtuous.\n\nXLI\nIt is a mark of want of intellect to spend much time in things relating to the body, as to be immoderate in exercises, in eating and drinking, and in the discharge of other animal functions. These things should be done incidentally and our main strength be applied to our reason.\n\nXLII\nWhen any person does ill by you, or speaks ill of you, remember that he acts or speaks from an impression that it is right for him to do so. Now it is not possible that he should follow what appears right to you, but only what appears so to himself. Therefore, if he judges from false appearances, he is the person hurt, since he, too, is the person deceived. For if anyone takes a true proposition to be false, the proposition is not hurt, but only the man is deceived. Setting out, then, from these principles, you will meekly bear with a person who reviles you, for you will say upon every occasion, “It seemed so to him.”\n\nXLIII\nEverything has two handles: one by which it may be borne, another by which it cannot. If your brother acts unjustly, do not lay hold on the affair by the handle of his injustice, for by that it cannot be borne, but rather by the opposite—that he is your brother, that he was brought up with you; and thus you will lay hold on it as it is to be borne.\n\nXLIV\nThese reasonings have no logical connection: “I am richer than you, therefore I am your superior.” “I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am your superior.” The true logical connection is rather this: “I am richer than you, therefore my possessions must exceed yours.” “I am more eloquent than you, therefore my style must surpass yours.” But you, after all, consist neither in property nor in style.\n\nXLV\nDoes anyone bathe hastily? Do not say that he does it ill, but hastily. Does anyone drink much wine? Do not say that he does ill, but that he drinks a great deal. For unless you perfectly understand his motives, how should you know if he acts ill? Thus you will not risk yielding to any appearances but such as you fully comprehend.\n\nXLVI\nNever proclaim yourself a philosopher, nor make much talk among the ignorant about your principles, but show them by actions. Thus, at an entertainment, do not discourse how people ought to eat, but eat as you ought. For remember that thus Socrates also universally avoided all ostentation. And when persons came to him and desired to be introduced by him to philosophers, he took them and introduced them; so well did he bear being overlooked. So if ever there should be among the ignorant any discussion of principles, be for the most part silent. For there is great danger in hastily throwing out what is undigested. And if anyone tells you that you know nothing, and you are not nettled at it, then you may be sure that you have really entered on your work. For sheep do not hastily throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten, but, inwardly digesting their food, they produce it outwardly in wool and milk. Thus, therefore, do you not make an exhibition before the ignorant of your principles, but of the actions to which their digestion gives rise.\n\nXLVII\nWhen you have learned to nourish your body frugally, do not pique yourself upon it; nor, if you drink water, be saying upon every occasion, “I drink water.” But first consider how much more frugal are the poor than we, and how much more patient of hardship. If at any time you would inure yourself by exercise to labor and privation, for your own sake and not for the public, do not attempt great feats; but when you are violently thirsty, just rinse your mouth with water, and tell nobody.\n\nXLVIII\nThe condition and characteristic of a vulgar person is that he never looks for either help or harm from himself, but only from externals. The condition and characteristic of a philosopher is that he looks to himself for all help or harm. The marks of a proficient are that he censures no one, praises no one, blames no one, accuses no one; says nothing concerning himself as being anybody or knowing anything. When he is in any instance hindered or restrained, he accuses himself; and if he is praised, he smiles to himself at the person who praises him; and if he is censured, he makes no defense. But he goes about with the caution of a convalescent, careful of interference with anything that is doing well but not yet quite secure. He restrains desire; he transfers his aversion to those things only which thwart the proper use of our own will; he employs his energies moderately in all directions; if he appears stupid or ignorant, he does not care; and, in a word, he keeps watch over himself as over an enemy and one in ambush.\n\nXLIX\nWhen anyone shows himself vain on being able to understand and interpret the works of Chrysippus,[7] say to yourself: “Unless Chrysippus had written obscurely, this person would have had nothing to be vain of. But what do I desire? To understand nature, and follow her. I ask, then, who interprets her; and hearing that Chrysippus does, I have recourse to him. I do not understand his writings. I seek, therefore, one to interpret them.” So far there is nothing to value myself upon. And when I find an interpreter, what remains is to make use of his instructions. This alone is the valuable thing. But if I admire merely the interpretation, what do I become more than a grammarian, instead of a philosopher, except, indeed, that instead of Homer I interpret Chrysippus? When anyone, therefore, desires me to read Chrysippus to him, I rather blush when I cannot exhibit actions that are harmonious and consonant with his discourse.\n\nL\nWhatever rules you have adopted, abide by them as laws, and as if you would be impious to transgress them; and do not regard what anyone says of you, for this, after all, is no concern of yours. How long, then, will you delay to demand of yourself the noblest improvements, and in no instance to transgress the judgments of reason? You have received the philosophic principles with which you ought to be conversant; and you have been conversant with them. For what other master, then, do you wait as an excuse for this delay in self-reformation? You are no longer a boy but a grown man. If, therefore, you will be negligent and slothful, and always add procrastination to procrastination, purpose to purpose, and fix day after day in which you will attend to yourself, you will insensibly continue to accomplish nothing and, living and dying, remain of vulgar mind. This instant, then, think yourself worthy of living as a man grown up and a proficient. Let whatever appears to be the best be to you an inviolable law. And if any instance of pain or pleasure, glory or disgrace, be set before you, remember that now is the combat, now the Olympiad comes on, nor can it be put off; and that by one failure and defeat honor may be lost or—won. Thus Socrates became perfect, improving himself by everything, following reason alone. And though you are not yet a Socrates, you ought, however, to live as one seeking to be a Socrates.\n\nLI\nThe first and most necessary topic in philosophy is the practical application of principles, as, We ought not to lie; the second is that of demonstrations as, Why it is that we ought not to lie; the third, that which gives strength and logical connection to the other two, as, Why this is a demonstration. For what is demonstration? What is a consequence? What a contradiction? What truth? What falsehood? The third point is then necessary on account of the second; and the second on account of the first. But the most necessary, and that whereon we ought to rest, is the first. But we do just the contrary. For we spend all our time on the third point and employ all our diligence about that, and entirely neglect the first. Therefore, at the same time that we lie, we are very ready to show how it is demonstrated that lying is wrong.\n\nUpon all occasions we ought to have these maxims ready at hand:\n\nConduct me, Zeus, and thou, O Destiny,\nWherever your decrees have fixed my lot.\nI follow cheerfully; and, did I not,\nWicked and wretched, I must follow still.[8]\n\nWho’er yields properly to Fate is deemed\nWise among men, and knows the laws of Heaven.[9]\n\nAnd this third:\n\n“O Crito, if it thus pleases the gods, thus let it be.”[10] “Anytus and Melitus may kill me indeed; but hurt me they cannot.”[11]\n\n\nNOW THE TRANSLATION\n\n# Know What You Control (And What You Don’t)\n\nLife’s simple, really. There’s stuff you control, and stuff you don’t.\nWhat you *do* control: your opinions, your goals, what you chase, what\nyou avoid – basically, your thoughts and actions. Your inner game. What\nyou *don’t* control: your body (beyond basic upkeep), your stuff (car,\ncash), your reputation (what others think), your job title – basically,\nanything outside your own choices. The external stuff is shaky ground.\nTrying to force it is like yelling at the rain. If you mistake external\nthings (like someone else’s opinion) as essential for *your* happiness,\nyou’re setting yourself up for frustration, blame games, and stress.\nFocus only on mastering *your* game – your thoughts, choices, reactions.\nAccept external stuff for what it is: things that happen, but don’t\ndefine you. Do that, and no one can truly mess with your peace of mind.\nYou won’t feel powerless, you won’t blame others, you won’t act against\nyour better judgment. Your inner self stays strong.\n\n# Master Your Wants and Don’t Wants\n\nWanting things outside your control sets you up for disappointment.\nDesperately trying to avoid things outside your control (criticism,\nsetbacks, getting sick) makes you miserable when they happen. Smart\nmove: Stop trying to dodge external negatives you can’t guarantee\navoiding. Focus your avoidance *only* on inner screw-ups: making bad\njudgments, acting cowardly, giving in to weakness. As for desires? Dial\nback the desperate need for external wins for now. Focus on mastering\nyour inner world first. When you *do* need to pursue external goals\n(job, relationship), do it with purpose, but keep your cool regardless\nof the outcome.\n\n# See Things As They Really Are\n\nThat thing you love – phone, car, even a relationship? Remind yourself\nwhat it actually *is*. Your favorite gadget? It’s plastic and circuits,\nit can break. Your relationship? It involves mortal, flawed humans. This\nisn’t being negative; it’s being realistic. Acknowledging the temporary\nor fragile nature of things prepares you. If things change or break, you\ncan handle it with strength, not devastation.\n\n# Mentally Rehearse for Annoyances\n\nGoing to the gym? Expect crowds, maybe someone annoying. Driving? Expect\ntraffic. Meeting? Expect potential disagreements. Picture the likely\nfrustrations *before* they happen. Why? So you can decide *now* to\nhandle them well. Tell yourself: \"My goal isn’t just the\nworkout/drive/meeting, it’s also to keep my cool and act according to my\nprinciples.\" If annoyances pop up, you’re ready: \"Getting pissed wasn’t\nthe plan. Staying rational *was*.\"\n\n# It’s Your Reaction, Not the Event\n\nEvents themselves don’t upset you. Your *judgment* about the event does.\nA job rejection isn’t inherently terrible; the terror comes from your\n*belief* that it’s terrible. When you feel blocked, stressed, or hurt,\ndon’t blame people or circumstances. Blame your interpretation. The\nrookie blames others. The guy learning blames himself too harshly. The\nguy who gets it realizes the issue is his *judgment*, and works on that.\n\n# Don’t Ride on Borrowed Glory\n\nDon’t get puffed up about things that aren’t really *yours*. Bragging\n\"My car is fast\" or \"My team won\" is getting excited about the car’s\nengineering or the team’s effort, not *your* core worth. What *is* truly\nyours? How you *use* what life gives you – your choices, your actions,\nyour character. When you act with courage, wisdom, and integrity?\n*That’s* when you earn the right to feel genuine pride. You’re proud of\nsomething undeniably your own.\n\n# Stay Focused on the Main Mission\n\nThink of life like an important project or deployment. You might get\nside-tracked by cool opportunities or enjoyable distractions along the\nway. Enjoy them, but always keep the main mission in mind. Be ready to\ndrop the distractions when duty calls, when priorities shift, or when\nmajor life changes happen. Don’t get so lost in the side quests\n(possessions, fleeting pleasures, even relationships if they conflict\nwith core duties) that you forget your primary objective or aren’t ready\nfor the inevitable call to move on or face reality. If you’re getting\nolder, stay even more focused – the final call could come anytime.\n\n# Want What Is, Not What You Wish\n\nStop wishing life would perfectly match your desires. That’s a direct\npath to frustration. Instead, learn to *want* things to happen exactly\nas they *do* happen. Align your will with reality. Master this, and\nyou’ll navigate life much more smoothly.\n\n# Obstacles Are External, Not Core\n\nGetting injured? That limits your body, but only limits your *will* if\nyou let it. A setback at work blocks that project, but doesn’t block\nyour *will* to adapt, learn, and persevere. Apply this everywhere.\nSetbacks hinder *something else*, not *you*—your essential self—unless\nyou give them permission by surrendering your judgment.\n\n# Know Your Inner Toolkit\n\nFacing a challenge? Ask yourself: \"What inner tool do I have for this?\"\nTempted by something you know is wrong? Tool: Self-control. Facing\nhardship? Tool: Endurance. Dealing with insults? Tool: Patience.\nPractice identifying and using the right inner tool, and external stuff\nloses its power to knock you down.\n\n# Think \"Returned,\" Not \"Lost\"\n\nNever say \"I lost it.\" Think \"I returned it.\" Relationship ended?\nReturned. Lost money? Returned. Job gone? Returned. \"But it was unfair\nhow it happened!\" Does the *method* of return change the fact that\nnothing external was ever permanently yours? While life lets you have\nsomething, treat it like borrowed equipment – appreciate it, use it\nwell, but know it’s on loan.\n\n# Peace Over Agitated Wealth\n\nStop agonizing: \"If I don’t constantly grind, I’ll fail!\" or \"If I don’t\nmicromanage everyone, they’ll screw up!\" Seriously, it’s better to face\nstruggles with inner calm than to be rich but constantly stressed and\nanxious. It’s better for your team to be imperfect than for *you* to be\nmiserable trying to force their perfection. Start small. Minor screw-up\nhappens? Tell yourself, \"Small price for keeping my cool.\" Someone\ndoesn’t respond instantly? Their actions are theirs. Don’t give them the\npower to ruin your peace.\n\n# Be Okay Looking ’Clueless’ on Externals\n\nIf you’re serious about inner strength, accept you might seem out of\ntouch with trends, gossip, or status games. Don’t feel pressured to know\neverything external. Even if others see you as ’important,’ stay\nskeptical of that image. You can’t easily max out your inner game *and*\nthe external status game simultaneously. Focusing hard on one means less\nfocus on the other. Choose wisely.\n\n# True Freedom is Wanting Only What You Control\n\nWishing things you can’t control were different (people living forever,\nfriends never failing you, markets always going up) is foolish and\nguarantees pain. You’re wanting reality to bend to your will. Wanting\n*not to be disappointed*? That *is* in your power. How? Focus your\ndesires on what you *do* control: your choices, your efforts, your\nintegrity. Whoever controls what you desperately crave or fear is your\nmaster. Want freedom? Stop needing things that depend on others or luck.\nOtherwise, you’re choosing slavery to circumstance.\n\n# Handle Opportunities with Class\n\nThink of life offering opportunities like food at a gathering (not a\nstuffy banquet, maybe just a buffet or network event). Something good\ncomes your way (a job lead, a chance to connect)? Take a reasonable\nshare politely. Does it pass you by? Don’t grab at it desperately or\ncomplain. Hasn’t arrived yet? Don’t stare hungrily; wait patiently.\nApply this to career, relationships, money. Handle them with moderation\nwhen available, detachment when not. Better yet, develop the strength to\n*politely decline* things you don’t truly need, even if offered. That\nshows real power – the strength of self-sufficiency.\n\n# Offer Support Without Catching the Panic\n\nSee someone genuinely upset? Offer support. Listen. Show empathy. But\ninternally, hold onto your rational perspective. Remind yourself: \"The\n*event* isn’t the core problem; their *judgment* about the event is\ncausing the deep pain.\" Be compassionate outwardly, but don’t let their\npanic infect your own mind. *Don’t groan inwardly.*\n\n# Play Your Assigned Role Well\n\nLife casts you in a role. Maybe it’s challenging, maybe it seems minor,\nmaybe it’s prominent. Your job isn’t to complain about the casting. Your\njob is to play the role you’ve been *given* to the absolute best of your\nability, with skill and integrity. Choosing the role isn’t up to you;\nplaying it excellently *is*.\n\n# Signs Mean What You Decide They Mean\n\nBad news? Weird coincidence? Feeling ’unlucky’? Don’t get spooked by\nsuperficial signs. Analyze: \"This external thing says nothing definitive\nabout *my* core self.\" Adopt this mindset: \"Any event can be a ’good\nsign’ *for me* if I choose to use it well – to practice patience,\ncourage, learning, adaptation.\" You decide the meaning by how you\nrespond.\n\n# You’re Unbeatable If You Only Fight Winnable Battles\n\nWant to guarantee you’re never truly defeated? Only enter contests where\nwinning depends *solely on you*. That means focusing on internal battles\nof character, not external competitions for status. See someone with\nimmense power, fame, or accolades? Don’t automatically assume they’re\n’happy’ or ’winning’ at life. If true Good lies in our choices (which we\ncontrol), then envy makes no sense. Your goal isn’t to be CEO or famous.\nYour goal is *freedom*. The only path? Disregard things not in your\ncontrol.\n\n# Insults Need Your Agreement to Hurt\n\nSomeone insults you or acts aggressively? That person isn’t the *source*\nof the hurt. Your *decision* to view their words/actions as insulting\n*is*. When provoked, realize: your *opinion* is provoking you. First\nstep: Pause. Don’t get instantly swept away. Gain a moment of breathing\nroom, and you’ll find it much easier to stay in command of yourself.\n\n# Keep Mortality and Hardship in Mind\n\nRegularly contemplate the tough realities: loss, failure, pain, and\nespecially death. Keep them visible in your mind’s eye. This isn’t\nmorbid; it’s grounding. It strips away petty fears, stops you from\ndesperately clinging to fleeting things, builds courage, and clarifies\nwhat truly matters.\n\n# Expect Pushback When You Improve\n\nCommit to living by these rules, to seriously working on yourself?\nPrepare for some people to mock you: \"Look who’s suddenly Mr. Serious,\"\nor \"Trying to be better than us?\" Don’t react by actually becoming\narrogant. Just quietly, consistently stick to the path you judge right.\nIf you persist, the mockers might eventually respect you. Cave to their\npressure? You earn double ridicule – for trying, and for failing weakly.\n\n# Don’t Compromise Principles for Approval\n\nCatch yourself tweaking your actions or beliefs just to impress someone\nor fit in? Stop. You’ve just sabotaged your own integrity project. Be\ncontent simply *being* a person of principle. If you need validation,\nseek it from your *own* rational self-assessment. That’s the only\naudience that counts.\n\n# Define Your Worth and Contribution Correctly\n\nDon’t get stressed thinking: \"I’ll be overlooked, a nobody.\" Lack of\nexternal status isn’t a true evil. It’s not your core mission to chase\npower or invites. How can you be a ’nobody’ when you can be a ’somebody’\nof great consequence in the *only* arena that counts – your own\ncharacter? \"But I can’t help my friends/family (with\nmoney/connections)!\" Who said *that kind* of help defines your value?\nCan you give integrity if you sacrifice yours chasing wealth? If they\ndemand you lose your own genuine good (honor) so they can gain a\nsuperficial one (cash), that’s *their* flawed thinking. Better to *be* a\nreliable, honorable person for them than to become corrupt trying to\nprovide mere externals. Same for ’helping your country’ – being one more\ncitizen of integrity *is* a vital contribution. Your ’place’? Whatever\nyou can hold while keeping your honor intact.\n\n# Recognize the ’Price’ of External Rewards\n\nSomeone else gets the promotion, the invite, the attention? If those\nthings were obtained virtuously, great for them. If they required\ncompromises you weren’t willing to make (flattery, sucking up, ethical\nshortcuts), then don’t be upset you didn’t get them. You can’t expect\nthe rewards without paying the ’price’. These things are often ’sold’\nfor a certain kind of behavior. If you’re unwilling to pay that price,\ndon’t demand the goods for free. You didn’t get the invite? Fine. What\n*did* you get instead? The freedom of *not* having to kiss ass, the\nrelief of *not* praising someone you don’t respect, the integrity of\nstaying true to yourself. That has value too.\n\n# Universal Rules Apply to You, Too\n\nWhen your neighbor’s car gets dented, you think, \"Unlucky, but stuff\nhappens.\" When *your* car gets dented, you lose your mind. Why the\ndifference? Learn to apply the same objective standard to yourself that\nyou naturally apply to others. Hear about someone else facing a common\nhardship? Note your reaction (\"That’s tough, a part of life\"). When it\nhappens to *you*, recall that reaction and strive for the same rational\nacceptance.\n\n# Reality Isn’t Designed for Failure\n\nJust like a target isn’t set up *hoping* you’ll miss, the universe\nwasn’t fundamentally designed with ’evil’ or ’failure’ as its goal.\nThese arise from missing the mark – from our errors in judgment, our\nfailure to live according to reason.\n\n# Guard Your Mind Fiercely\n\nYou’d be furious if someone physically restrained you or messed with\nyour body without permission. So why do you casually hand over your\n*mind* to any random person who insults you online or criticizes you?\nWhy let their words instantly hijack your inner state? Protect your\nmental space more fiercely than your property.\n\n# Count the Cost Before Committing\n\nBefore jumping into any big endeavor (a tough project, intense training,\na major life change), seriously consider the prep work, the sacrifices,\nthe potential difficulties, and the long-term consequences. Don’t just\nleap in on pure enthusiasm. Understand the *full* scope – the grind, the\ndiscipline, the risk of failure. Weigh it honestly against your capacity\nand commitment. *Then* decide. Otherwise, you’ll start strong and quit\nwhen it gets real, looking foolish. Decide if you’re willing to pay the\nfull price for serenity and strength – which often involves less\ncomfort, less external validation, more discipline. Choose one path:\ncultivate your reason and character, or chase externals like everyone\nelse. You can’t be both half-heartedly.\n\n# Your Duties Flow From Your Roles\n\nYour responsibilities are defined by your relationships. Father? Implies\ncare, respect, patience. Brother? Implies loyalty, fairness *from your\nend*. Boss? Implies leadership, responsibility. Employee? Implies\ndiligence, respect. \"But they’re a *bad* father/brother/boss!\" Your duty\nisn’t tied to *their* perfection; it’s tied to the *role*. Focus on\nfulfilling *your* side of the relationship virtuously, according to\nreason. Don’t let their actions dictate your integrity. Remember, you’re\nonly hurt if you *consent* to the idea of being hurt by judging their\nactions as harmful to your core self.\n\n# Real Respect for Reality: Right Judgment \u0026 Acceptance\n\nTrue respect for the way things are (the Universe, Nature, Reality)\nmeans holding correct beliefs: understanding that the world operates by\ncause and effect, and striving to live in harmony with that reality.\nCommit to obeying this natural order, accepting what happens without\ncomplaint, trusting that even difficulties can be navigated wisely.\nYou’ll never find fault with reality itself if you stop demanding it\ncater to your whims, and locate good/evil only in your own choices. If\nyou pin your hopes on externals, you’re guaranteed to feel betrayed or\nneglected when things don’t go your way. Carefully manage your desires\n(aim for virtue) and aversions (avoid vice), and your ’piety’ or respect\nfor reality will follow. (Traditional rituals, if practiced, should be\ndone respectfully and moderately).\n\n# Seeking Guidance (From Experts or ’Fate’)\n\nWhen seeking advice about an uncertain future (from a mentor, data, or\neven just contemplating probabilities), remember: you don’t know the\nspecific outcome. But you *should* know its *nature* if it’s external:\nit’s neither truly good nor truly evil *for your core self*. Don’t\napproach seeking guidance full of desperate hope or fear. Understand\nfirst: any external event is neutral *to you* because you always have\nthe power to respond wisely. Approach with confidence, ready to use\nwhatever comes. When clear duty requires facing risk (defending a\nfriend, taking a necessary business risk), don’t seek guidance on\n*whether* to do it. Reason already tells you. Potential negative\noutcomes (loss, failure, pain) don’t override duty. Listen to your\nrational conscience above all predictions.\n\n# Your Personal Code of Conduct\n\nEstablish clear standards for yourself, for when you’re alone and with\nothers.\n\n- **Talk less, say more:** Mostly silent, or speak only what’s needed,\n  concisely. Avoid constant chatter about trivial stuff (sports stats,\n  gossip, food). Especially avoid judging people. Steer conversations to\n  substance if you can; if stuck in trivia, silence is fine.\n\n- **Control reactions:** Moderate laughter. Avoid unnecessary\n  oaths/swearing.\n\n- **Choose environments wisely:** Skip trashy entertainment. If you must\n  be there, stay mentally sharp, don’t get sucked into mob mentality.\n  Bad company corrupts.\n\n- **Needs, not wants:** Provide for your body’s basic needs only. Cut\n  luxury and showing off.\n\n- **Handle relationships ethically:** Maintain integrity in\n  relationships. Don’t be harsh on others’ failings, but don’t brag\n  about your own discipline either.\n\n- **Handle criticism calmly:** Someone trash-talks you? Don’t make\n  excuses. Maybe say: \"Guess they don’t know my *other* flaws.\"\n\n- **Events:** Attend selectively. If there, wish for the best outcome\n  based on merit, don’t get emotionally swept up. Afterwards, discuss\n  lessons learned, not just surface details.\n\n- **Meetings:** Prepare mentally. How would a wise person handle this?\n  Anticipate hassles (delays, closed doors) – if duty requires going,\n  accept what happens without complaint.\n\n- **Self-promotion:** Avoid constantly talking about yourself, your\n  exploits, your risks. It bores others. Avoid trying too hard to be\n  funny – often backfires. Avoid crude talk; if others do it, show\n  disapproval silently or firmly.\n\n# Pause Before Pleasure\n\nTempted by a quick hit of pleasure (junk food, procrastination, risky\nclick)? Pause. Delay. Don’t get swept away. Now, picture two moments:\nenjoying it, then regretting it later. Contrast that with how you’ll\nfeel – proud, strong – if you abstain. Even if it seems harmless, weigh\nthe temporary allure against the lasting satisfaction of winning that\ninternal battle.\n\n# Act Rightly, Openly\n\nIf you’ve judged an action to be right, do it. Don’t hide it, even if\nothers might misunderstand. If your judgment was wrong, don’t do the\naction. If it was right, why fear mistaken critics?\n\n# Social Context Matters\n\nIn logic, \"Either A or B\" is fine. At a shared meal, taking the biggest\npiece might satisfy hunger but breaks social rules. Remember both:\nphysical needs *and* social consideration. Act appropriately for the\ncontext.\n\n# Don’t Pretend Beyond Your Abilities\n\nTaking on a role or project way beyond your current skill level? You’ll\nlikely fail at it *and* miss the chance to succeed at something you\n*could* have handled. Be honest about your current capacity. Grow into\nbigger roles, don’t just fake them.\n\n# Protect Your Mind Like Your Body\n\nYou watch where you step to avoid injury. Be even *more* careful to\nguard your mind – your reason, your judgment – from harm (bad\ninfluences, irrational thoughts, hasty conclusions). Vigilance here\nmakes every action safer.\n\n# Needs Have Limits, Wants Don’t\n\nYour body needs certain things (food, shelter), like your foot needs the\nright size shoe. Stick to meeting genuine needs, and you have a clear\nmeasure. Go beyond – chasing luxury, status symbols, excess – and you’re\non a slippery slope with no end. Once you exceed the natural measure,\ndesire becomes boundless.\n\n# Focus on Character, Not Just Image\n\nSociety pushes everyone to focus on superficials – looks, wealth,\nstatus. People then pour energy into that image, hoping for respect.\nRealize this: validation based on externals is flimsy. True, lasting\nhonor comes from inner qualities: integrity, rational conduct, genuine\nconfidence (not arrogance). Focus your main effort there.\n\n# Mind First, Body Second\n\nSpending excessive time obsessing over the body (extreme diets, endless\nworkout tweaking, constant health anxiety) shows a lack of perspective.\nHandle physical needs efficiently, as maintenance for the tool. Your\n*primary* focus and energy should go to strengthening your mind and\ncharacter.\n\n# Understand Their Perspective (Even When Wrong)\n\nSomeone acts badly towards you? They’re acting based on *their*\nperception of what’s right or necessary. They can’t see it your way;\nthey only see it theirs. If their perception is flawed, *they* are the\nones harmed by being mistaken. Think: If someone believes 2+2\u003d5, the\nmath isn’t harmed, they are. Bearing this in mind allows you to respond\ncalmly, thinking, \"That’s how it *seemed to them*.\"\n\n# Grab the Right Handle\n\nEverything has two handles: one that lets you carry it, one that makes\nit unbearable. Brother wrongs you? Don’t grab the \"injustice\" handle\n(unbearable). Grab the \"he’s my brother, we share history\" handle\n(bearable). Always choose the perspective that allows you to respond\nvirtuously and constructively.\n\n# Don’t Confuse Externals with Essence\n\n\"I have more money, so I’m *better*.\" Wrong. It just means \"I have more\n*money*.\" \"I talk smoother, so I’m *superior*.\" Wrong. It just means \"My\n*style* is smoother.\" *You* are not your bank account or your speaking\nstyle. Don’t equate external advantages with core worth.\n\n# Describe, Don’t Rush to Judge\n\nSomeone acts quickly? Say they act *quickly*, not *badly*. Someone\ndrinks a lot? Say they *drink a lot*, not that they’re doing *wrong*.\nUnless you understand their full reasoning and context, how can you know\nthe true nature of their action? Stick to facts. Avoid judgment based on\nmere appearances you don’t fully grasp.\n\n# Live Your Principles, Don’t Just Talk\n\nNever declare \"I follow these Rules!\" Don’t lecture others. *Show* it by\nyour actions. At a meal, don’t preach about healthy eating; just eat\nhealthily. Be like Socrates: he avoided showmanship. If someone says\n\"You know nothing\" and you *aren’t* angered, you’re likely on the right\ntrack. Sheep don’t show off undigested grass; they produce wool and\nmilk. Digest these principles internally; let your *actions* be the\noutward proof.\n\n# Practice Discipline Quietly, For Yourself\n\nLearned some self-discipline (eating simply, exercising regularly)?\nDon’t boast. If you drink water, don’t make it a public announcement. If\nyou want to train for hardship, do it for *you*, not for show. Practice\nquiet mastery: severely thirsty? Rinse your mouth, spit it out, *tell\nnobody*.\n\n# Where Do You Look for Good/Bad?\n\nUntrained person: Looks *outside* – blames or credits external factors\nfor everything. Student of these rules: Looks *inside* – takes\nresponsibility for their judgments and choices as the source of good or\nbad. Signs of progress: Criticizes no one, praises no one excessively,\nblames no one, accuses no one. Doesn’t talk about self as important.\nTakes responsibility for setbacks. Isn’t swayed by praise or blame.\nMoves cautiously, protecting their inner progress. Manages desires and\naversions internally. Uses energy moderately. Doesn’t care about\nappearing foolish externally. Watches self like an enemy agent.\n\n# Use Wisdom, Don’t Just Admire Its Study\n\nImpressive someone understands complex theories (of science, philosophy,\nfinance)? Fine. But the original thinker likely wrote complex stuff.\nWhat’s *your* goal? To understand reality and live well. You seek\ninterpretations to help *apply* the knowledge. The application is the\nonly valuable part. Admiring the interpretation itself makes you a\ncommentator, not a practitioner. Better to live consistently with one\nsimple principle than to expertly explain complex theories you don’t\npractice.\n\n# The Time is Now. No More Delays.\n\nStick to the principles you’ve rationally accepted like unbreakable\nlaws. Ignore what others say – it’s irrelevant. How much longer will you\nwait to demand the best from yourself? You have the tools. Stop making\nexcuses. You’re an adult now. Constant delay, planning to plan – that\npath leads nowhere but mediocrity. Decide *now* you’re worthy of living\nas a progressing adult. Let your highest reasoned judgment be your\nguide. Pain, pleasure, fame, failure – the challenge is *here*, the\ncontest is *now*. It can’t be postponed. Every moment is a chance to win\nor lose ground internally. Live like you’re *striving* to be your best\nself, starting this instant.\n\n# Action First, Theory Second\n\nThe most crucial part of living well is *doing* the right thing (e.g.,\nBe honest). Second is understanding *why* (e.g., Why honesty matters).\nThird is analyzing the logic (e.g., How arguments for honesty work). We\nneed #2 for #1, and #3 helps #2. But #1 – the actual practice – is the\nmost essential. Yet we often get stuck debating #3, becoming experts at\nexplaining *why* we should be honest, while still failing at #1.\nPrioritize action.\n\n# Core Attitudes to Keep Ready\n\nKeep these fundamental mindsets always at hand:\n\n1.  **Accept What Life Brings:**\n\n    \u003e Whatever Life and Fate decree for me,  \n    \u003e I’ll follow willingly, without complaint.  \n    \u003e Or if I foolishly resist in pain,  \n    \u003e I’ll follow anyway, just dragged along.\n\n2.  **Wisdom in Acceptance:**\n\n    \u003e The wise accept what they can’t change or fight,  \n    \u003e And understand the laws of day and night.\n\n3.  **Embrace Reality:**\n\n    \u003e (Like Socrates said) \"If this is how things must be, so be it.\"\n\n4.  **Protect Your Inner Self:**\n\n    \u003e (Like Socrates knew) \"Others can harm my body or reputation, maybe\n    \u003e even kill me, but they cannot touch my true self or make me do\n    \u003e wrong.\"\n\n\nNew target text\n\nFrom my grandfather Verus I learned good morals and the government of my temper.\n\nFrom the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character.\n\nFrom my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence, not only from evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts; and further, simplicity in my way of living, far removed from the habits of the rich.\n\nFrom my great-grandfather, not to have frequented public schools, and to have had good teachers at home, and to know that on such things a man should spend liberally.\n\nFrom my governor, to be neither of the green nor of the blue party at the games in the Circus, nor a partizan either of the Parmularius or the Scutarius at the gladiators\u0027 fights; from him too I learned endurance of labour, and to want little, and to work with my own hands, and not to meddle with other people\u0027s affairs, and not to be ready to listen to slander.\n\nFrom Diognetus, not to busy myself about trifling things, and not to give credit to what was said by miracle-workers and jugglers about incantations and the driving away of daemons and such things; and not to breed quails for fighting, nor to give myself up passionately to such things; and to endure freedom of speech; and to have become intimate with philosophy; and to have been a hearer, first of Bacchius, then of Tandasis and Marcianus; and to have written dialogues in my youth; and to have desired a plank bed and skin, and whatever else of the kind belongs to the Grecian discipline.\n\nFrom Rusticus I received the impression that my character required improvement and discipline; and from him I learned not to be led astray to sophistic emulation, nor to writing on speculative matters, nor to delivering little hortatory orations, nor to showing myself off as a man who practises much discipline, or does benevolent acts in order to make a display; and to abstain from rhetoric, and poetry, and fine writing; and not to walk about in the house in my outdoor dress, nor to do other things of the kind; and to write my letters with simplicity, like the letter which Rusticus wrote from Sinuessa to my mother; and with respect to those who have offended me by words, or done me wrong, to be easily disposed to be pacified and reconciled, as soon as they have shown a readiness to be reconciled; and to read carefully, and not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding of a book; nor hastily to give my assent to those who talk overmuch; and I am indebted to him for being acquainted with the discourses of Epictetus, which he communicated to me out of his own collection.\n\nFrom Apollonius I learned freedom of will and undeviating steadiness of purpose; and to look to nothing else, not even for a moment, except to reason; and to be always the same, in sharp pains, on the occasion of the loss of a child, and in long illness; and to see clearly in a living example that the same man can be both most resolute and yielding, and not peevish in giving his instruction; and to have had before my eyes a man who clearly considered his experience and his skill in expounding philosophical principles as the smallest of his merits; and from him I learned how to receive from friends what are esteemed favours, without being either humbled by them or letting them pass unnoticed.\n\nFrom Sextus, a benevolent disposition, and the example of a family governed in a fatherly manner, and the idea of living conformably to nature; and gravity without affectation, and to look carefully after the interests of friends, and to tolerate ignorant persons, and those who form opinions without consideration: he had the power of readily accommodating himself to all, so that intercourse with him was more agreeable than any flattery; and at the same time he was most highly venerated by those who associated with him: and he had the faculty both of discovering and ordering, in an intelligent and methodical way, the principles necessary for life; and he never showed anger or any other passion, but was entirely free from passion, and also most affectionate; and he could express approbation without noisy display, and he possessed much knowledge without ostentation.\n\nFrom Alexander the grammarian, to refrain from fault-finding, and not in a reproachful way to chide those who uttered any barbarous or solecistic or strange-sounding expression; but dexterously to introduce the very expression which ought to have been used, and in the way of answer or giving confirmation, or joining in an inquiry about the thing itself, not about the word, or by some other fit suggestion.\n\nFrom Fronto I learned to observe what envy, and duplicity, and hypocrisy are in a tyrant, and that generally those among us who are called Patricians are rather deficient in paternal affection.\n\nFrom Alexander the Platonic, not frequently nor without necessity to say to any one, or to write in a letter, that I have no leisure; nor continually to excuse the neglect of duties required by our relation to those with whom we live, by alleging urgent occupations.\n\nFrom Catulus, not to be indifferent when a friend finds fault, even if he should find fault without reason, but to try to restore him to his usual disposition; and to be ready to speak well of teachers, as it is reported of Domitius and Athenodotus; and to love my children truly.\n\nFrom my brother Severus, to love my kin, and to love truth, and to love justice; and through him I learned to know Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dion, Brutus; and from him I received the idea of a polity in which there is the same law for all, a polity administered with regard to equal rights and equal freedom of speech, and the idea of a kingly government which respects most of all the freedom of the governed; I learned from him also consistency and undeviating steadiness in my regard for philosophy; and a disposition to do good, and to give to others readily, and to cherish good hopes, and to believe that I am loved by my friends; and in him I observed no concealment of his opinions with respect to those whom he condemned, and that his friends had no need to conjecture what he wished or did not wish, but it was quite plain.\n\nFrom Maximus I learned self-government, and not to be led aside by anything; and cheerfulness in all circumstances, as well as in illness; and a just admixture in the moral character of sweetness and dignity, and to do what was set before me without complaining. I observed that everybody believed that he thought as he spoke, and that in all that he did he never had any bad intention; and he never showed amazement and surprise, and was never in a hurry, and never put off doing a thing, nor was perplexed nor dejected, nor did he ever laugh to disguise his vexation, nor, on the other hand, was he ever passionate or suspicious. He was accustomed to do acts of beneficence, and was ready to forgive, and was free from all falsehood; and he presented the appearance of a man who could not be diverted from right rather than of a man who had been improved. I observed, too, that no man could ever think that he was despised by Maximus, or ever venture to think himself a better man. He had also the art of being humorous in an agreeable way.\n\nIn my father I observed mildness of temper, and unchangeable resolution in the things which he had determined after due deliberation; and no vainglory in those things which men call honours; and a love of labour and perseverance; and a readiness to listen to those who had anything to propose for the common weal; and undeviating firmness in giving to every man according to his deserts; and a knowledge derived from experience of the occasions for vigorous action and for remission. And I observed that he had overcome all passion for boys; and he considered himself no more than any other citizen; and he released his friends from all obligation to sup with him or to attend him of necessity when he went abroad, and those who had failed to accompany him, by reason of any urgent circumstances, always found him the same. I observed too his habit of careful inquiry in all matters of deliberation, and his persistency, and that he never stopped his investigation through being satisfied with appearances which first present themselves; and that his disposition was to keep his friends, and not to be soon tired of them, nor yet to be extravagant in his affection; and to be satisfied on all occasions, and cheerful; and to foresee things a long way off, and to provide for the smallest without display; and to check immediately popular applause and all flattery; and to be ever watchful over the things which were necessary for the administration of the empire, and to be a good manager of the expenditure, and patiently to endure the blame which he got for such conduct; and he was neither superstitious with respect to the gods, nor did he court men by gifts or by trying to please them, or by flattering the populace; but he showed sobriety in all things and firmness, and never any mean thoughts or action, nor love of novelty. And the things which conduce in any way to the commodity of life, and of which fortune gives an abundant supply, he used without arrogance and without excusing himself; so that when he had them, he enjoyed them without affectation, and when he had them not, he did not want them. No one could ever say of him that he was either a sophist or a home-bred flippant slave or a pedant; but every one acknowledged him to be a man ripe, perfect, above flattery, able to manage his own and other men\u0027s affairs. Besides this, he honoured those who were true philosophers, and he did not reproach those who pretended to be philosophers, nor yet was he easily led by them. He was also easy in conversation, and he made himself agreeable without any offensive affectation. He took a reasonable care of his body\u0027s health, not as one who was greatly attached to life, nor out of regard to personal appearance, nor yet in a careless way, but so that, through his own attention, he very seldom stood in need of the physician\u0027s art or of medicine or external applications. He was most ready to give way without envy to those who possessed any particular faculty, such as that of eloquence or knowledge of the law or of morals, or of anything else; and he gave them his help, that each might enjoy reputation according to his deserts; and he always acted conformably to the institutions of his country, without showing any affectation of doing so. Further, he was not fond of change nor unsteady, but he loved to stay in the same places, and to employ himself about the same things; and after his paroxysms of headache he came immediately fresh and vigorous to his usual occupations. His secrets were not but very few and very rare, and these only about public matters; and he showed prudence and economy in the exhibition of the public spectacles and the construction of public buildings, his donations to the people, and in such things, for he was a man who looked to what ought to be done, not to the reputation which is got by a man\u0027s acts. He did not take the bath at unseasonable hours; he was not fond of building houses, nor curious about what he ate, nor about the texture and colour of his clothes, nor about the beauty of his slaves. His dress came from Lorium, his villa on the coast, and from Lanuvium generally. We know how he behaved to the toll-collector at Tusculum who asked his pardon; and such was all his behaviour. There was in him nothing harsh, nor implacable, nor violent, nor, as one may say, anything carried to the sweating point; but he examined all things severally, as if he had abundance of time, and without confusion, in an orderly way, vigorously and consistently. And that might be applied to him which is recorded of Socrates, that he was able both to abstain from, and to enjoy, those things which many are too weak to abstain from, and cannot enjoy without excess. But to be strong enough both to bear the one and to be sober in the other is the mark of a man who has a perfect and invincible soul, such as he showed in the illness of Maximus.\n\nTo the gods I am indebted for having good grandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good teachers, good associates, good kinsmen and friends, nearly everything good. Further, I owe it to the gods that I was not hurried into any offence against any of them, though I had a disposition which, if opportunity had offered, might have led me to do something of this kind; but, through their favour, there never was such a concurrence of circumstances as put me to the trial. Further, I am thankful to the gods that I was not longer brought up with my grandfather\u0027s concubine, and that I preserved the flower of my youth, and that I did not make proof of my virility before the proper season, but even deferred the time; that I was subjected to a ruler and a father who was able to take away all pride from me, and to bring me to the knowledge that it is possible for a man to live in a palace without wanting either guards or embroidered dresses, or torches and statues, and such-like show; but that it is in such a man\u0027s power to bring himself very near to the fashion of a private person, without being for this reason either meaner in thought, or more remiss in action, with respect to the things which must be done for the public interest in a manner that befits a ruler. I thank the gods for giving me such a brother, who was able by his moral character to rouse me to vigilance over myself, and who, at the same time, pleased me by his respect and affection; that my children have not been stupid nor deformed in body; that I did not make more proficiency in rhetoric, poetry, and the other studies, in which I should perhaps have been completely engaged, if I had seen that I was making progress in them; that I made haste to place those who brought me up in the station of honour, which they seemed to desire, without putting them off with hope of my doing it some time after, because they were then still young; that I knew Apollonius, Rusticus, Maximus; that I received clear and frequent impressions about living according to nature, and what kind of a life that is, so that, so far as depended on the gods, and their gifts, and help, and inspirations, nothing hindered me from forthwith living according to nature, though I still fall short of it through my own fault, and through not observing the admonitions of the gods, and, I may almost say, their direct instructions; that my body has held out so long in such a kind of life; that I never touched either Benedicta or Theodotus, and that, after having fallen into amatory passions, I was cured; and, though I was often out of humour with Rusticus, I never did anything of which I had occasion to repent; that, though it was my mother\u0027s fate to die young, she spent the last years of her life with me; that, whenever I wished to help any man in his need, or on any other occasion, I was never told that I had not the means of doing it; and that to myself the same necessity never happened, to receive anything from another; that I have such a wife, so obedient, and so affectionate, and so simple; that I had abundance of good masters for my children; and that remedies have been shown to me by dreams, both others, and against bloodspitting and giddiness...; and that, when I had an inclination to philosophy, I did not fall into the hands of any sophist, and that I did not waste my time on writers of histories, or in the resolution of syllogisms, or occupy myself about the investigation of appearances in the heavens; for all these things require the help of the gods and fortune.\n\nAmong the Quadi at the Granua.\n\n",

      "text": "Here\u0027s a thinking process that could lead to the \"bro version\" of Marcus Aurelius\u0027 Book 1:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants a \"bro version\" of Marcus Aurelius\u0027 *Meditations*, Book 1. They provided a \"bro version\" of Epictetus\u0027 *Enchiridion* as a template for style and tone. The key is to translate the formal, reflective language of Marcus Aurelius into modern, informal, relatable language, capturing the essence of his gratitude and the lessons learned, but in a \"bro\" voice.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Source Text (Marcus Aurelius, Book 1):**\n    *   **Structure:** It\u0027s a list of acknowledgments. Marcus thanks specific people (family, teachers, friends, mentors) for the specific virtues or lessons they taught him or exemplified. He then thanks the gods for circumstances and character traits.\n    *   **Content:** The lessons cover temperance, modesty, piety, practicality, resilience, intellectual honesty, emotional control, fairness, leadership qualities, humility, self-awareness, focus on reason, acceptance, duty, simplicity, good relationships, avoiding specific vices (superstition, anger, envy, gossip, showing off), and gratitude for fortune/fate.\n    *   **Tone:** Formal, introspective, grateful, humble, serious, analytical.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Target Style (\"Bro Version\"):**\n    *   **Language:** Informal, conversational, uses modern slang (\"dude,\" \"bro,\" \"stuff,\" \"kick ass,\" \"no BS,\" \"keep your cool,\" \"chill\"), contractions, shorter sentences, sometimes more direct or blunt.\n    *   **Tone:** Relatable, down-to-earth, action-oriented, sometimes slightly irreverent but still conveying the core message, focuses on practical application and avoiding pretension. Avoids overly academic or philosophical jargon. Uses analogies that might resonate with a \"bro\" audience (sports, projects, maybe even gym/lifting if applicable, though maybe less here).\n    *   **Core Message Preservation:** Despite the stylistic shift, the essential *meaning* and *lessons* from the original must be retained. It\u0027s translation, not parody (mostly).\n\n4.  **Develop a Strategy for Translation:**\n    *   **Go Person by Person:** Tackle each entry (Verus, Father, Mother, etc.) individually.\n    *   **Identify the Core Lesson:** For each person, pinpoint the key takeaway(s) Marcus attributes to them. E.g., Verus -\u003e good morals, controlling temper. Father -\u003e modesty, manliness. Mother -\u003e piety, beneficence, simplicity, avoiding bad thoughts.\n    *   **Rephrase in \"Bro\" Language:** Translate the identified lesson into the target style.\n        *   \"Good morals\" -\u003e \"how to be a decent dude,\" \"knowing right from wrong.\"\n        *   \"Government of my temper\" -\u003e \"keeping my cool,\" \"not flying off the handle.\"\n        *   \"Modesty\" -\u003e \"staying humble,\" \"not being a show-off.\"\n        *   \"Manly character\" -\u003e \"acting like a grown-ass man,\" \"having some backbone.\"\n        *   \"Piety and beneficence\" -\u003e \"respecting something bigger,\" \"being generous,\" \"looking out for people.\"\n        *   \"Abstinence from evil deeds/thoughts\" -\u003e \"not just avoiding screwing up, but keeping my head straight,\" \"no toxic thoughts.\"\n        *   \"Simplicity in living\" -\u003e \"keeping it real,\" \"not needing fancy crap.\"\n        *   \"Endurance of labour\" -\u003e \"how to grind,\" \"toughing it out.\"\n        *   \"Want little\" -\u003e \"being cool with less,\" \"not being needy.\"\n        *   \"Work with my own hands\" -\u003e \"getting shit done myself.\"\n        *   \"Not meddle\" -\u003e \"minding my own business.\"\n        *   \"Not listen to slander\" -\u003e \"ignoring gossip,\" \"no time for haters.\"\n        *   \"Freedom of speech\" -\u003e \"handling blunt feedback,\" \"letting people speak their minds.\"\n        *   \"Philosophy\" -\u003e \"this whole thinking-straight thing,\" \"working on my inner game.\"\n        *   \"Character required improvement\" -\u003e \"realizing I had work to do on myself,\" \"needed to level up.\"\n        *   \"Not led astray to sophistic emulation\" -\u003e \"avoiding pretentious intellectual BS,\" \"not trying to sound smart just to impress.\"\n        *   \"Abstain from rhetoric, poetry, fine writing\" -\u003e \"cutting the flowery language,\" \"keeping it straight.\"\n        *   \"Easily disposed

\"Sobriety and firmness\" -\u003e \"level-headed and solid.\"\n        *   \"Used abundance without arrogance\" -\u003e \"enjoying good stuff without being a dick about it.\"\n        *   \"Honoured true philosophers\" -\u003e \"respecting real wisdom.\"\n        *   \"Took reasonable care of his body\" -\u003e \"basic self-care, not vanity.\"\n        *   \"Ready to give way\" -\u003e \"not needing to be the smartest guy in the room,\" \"supporting others.\"\n        *   \"Nothing harsh, implacable, violent\" -\u003e \"never losing it,\" \"no rage-quitting life.\"\n    *   **Maintain the Gratitude:** Frame each point as something learned *from* that person. Use phrases like \"From [Name], I learned...\", \"He taught me...\", \"Showed me how to...\".\n    *   **Handle the \"Gods\" Section:** Translate \"the gods\" to something more modern/agnostic if desired, or keep it metaphorical. \"The universe,\" \"fate,\" \"luck,\" \"how things turned out.\" Focus on the *content* of the gratitude: good people, avoiding screw-ups, good health, good wife, useful experiences, not getting sidetracked.\n    *   **Keep the Context:** Mentioning specific names (like the chariot teams or gladiators) adds color. Briefly explain if needed or keep it concise to maintain flow. The closing location (\"Among the Quadi...\") can be kept as is, maybe with a slightly modern twist.\n\n5.  **Drafting - First Pass (Mental or Quick Notes):**\n    *   Verus: Be decent, keep cool.\n    *   Dad: Humble, solid.\n    *   Mom: Kind, generous, simple life, clean thoughts.\n    *   Great-Grandpa: Good home-schooling beats fancy schools, invest in good teachers.\n    *   Governor: Don\u0027t get obsessed with teams/politics, work hard, need less, DIY, mind own biz, ignore gossip.\n    *   Diognetus: No time for dumb stuff/superstition, avoid stupid hobbies, handle criticism, get into philosophy, write early, basic living (camp bed vibe).\n    *   Rusticus: Saw I needed work, avoid showing off smarts/good deeds, cut fancy talk, simple letters, forgive easily, read deep, distrust talkers, intro to Epictetus (big deal).\n    *   Apollonius: Own choices, stay focused, always use reason, stay steady through pain/loss, saw he could be tough *and* flexible, teaching wasn\u0027t his ego trip, how to accept help gracefully.\n    *   ...and so on for each person.\n\n6.  **Drafting - Writing it Out:** Flesh out the notes into sentences and paragraphs, applying the \"bro\" tone consistently. Add connecting phrases. Ensure it flows reasonably well. (This is where the provided example output is generated).\n\n7.  **Refining and Editing:**\n    *   **Read Aloud:** Does it sound natural (for the persona)?\n    *   **Check Tone Consistency:** Is it consistently \"bro\"? Any parts too formal or too silly?\n    *   **Check Meaning:** Does it accurately reflect Marcus\u0027s points? Is anything lost or distorted?\n    *   **Trim Fat:** Remove unnecessary words. Make it punchier where appropriate.\n    *   **Enhance \"Bro\" Elements:** Look for opportunities to add slightly more colloquialisms or relatable analogies *without* overdoing it or making it cringe. Ensure the slang feels relatively natural and not forced. (e.g., \"level up,\" \"inner game,\" \"keeping it real,\" \"no BS\").\n    *   **Final Polish:** Check for typos, grammatical errors (within the informal style). Ensure the overall message of gratitude and learned virtue comes through clearly beneath the casual language. Make sure the ending feels right.\n\nThis systematic process—understanding the goal, analyzing both source and target styles, strategizing the translation, drafting, and refining—helps ensure the final output meets the user\u0027s requirements while maintaining the integrity of the original text\u0027s core message.",

      "text": "Okay, I see the style you\u0027re going for.

Let\u0027s apply that same approach to Marcus Aurelius\u0027s *Meditations*, Book 1.\n\nHere\u0027s the \"bro version\" of Marcus Aurelius, Book 1, based on your target style:\n\n---\n\n**What I Learned from My Crew (And Reality)**\n\nAlright, gotta give credit where it\u0027s due. Here’s the rundown of who taught me what:\n\n1.  **From Grandpa Verus:** Learned how to be a decent dude and keep my cool. Basic good character and not losing my temper over dumb stuff.\n2.  **From my Dad’s Rep (and memory):** Humility and being a solid, reliable man. No BS, just quiet strength.\n3.  **From Mom:** Respect for the spiritual side of things, being generous, and steering clear of not just bad *actions*, but even toxic *thoughts*. Plus, keeping life simple, not needing all the flashy rich-guy crap.\n4.  **From Great-Grandpa:** Dodging the hype of big-name schools. Getting solid teachers at home was key, and realizing you gotta invest properly in good education.\n5.  **From my Tutor/Handler:** Not getting sucked into pointless team rivalries (like those chariot races or gladiator factions – basically, don\u0027t lose your mind over sports teams or politics). Also learned to grind, need less, do my own work, stay out of other people\u0027s drama, and ignore gossip and slander.\n6.  **From Diognetus:** Don\u0027t waste time on trivial crap. Ignore the snake oil salesmen, magic tricks, and superstition talk. Avoid dumb, aggressive hobbies (like fighting quails – yeah, weird). Value straight talk and getting into philosophy. Heard some solid thinkers (Bacchius, Tandasis, Marcianus). Tried writing serious stuff young. Got into that simple, tough Greek lifestyle (basic bed, minimal gear).\n7.  **From Rusticus:** Got the wake-up call that I seriously needed to work on myself. He steered me away from showing off intellectually, writing fluff pieces, giving cheesy motivational speeches, or making a big show of being disciplined or generous just for looks. Cut the fancy talk, poetry, and overly polished writing. Stop strutting around the house like you\u0027re on parade. Write simple, straight-up letters (like he did). Be ready to squash beefs and reconcile quick when someone messes up but wants to make it right. *Really* read stuff, don\u0027t just skim. Don\u0027t just blindly agree with loudmouths. Huge debt to him for hooking me up with Epictetus’s teachings from his own stash – game changer.\n8.  **From Apollonius:** Owning my choices and staying laser-focused on my goals. Always, *always* default to Reason, even for a second. Stay steady – through intense pain, losing a kid, long sicknesses. Saw in him a living example: you can be hardcore determined *and* flexible, and teach without being a cranky dick. Saw a guy who knew his real value wasn\u0027t just his smarts or teaching skills. Learned how to accept favors or help from friends without feeling weirdly indebted or just blowing it off. Handle generosity with grace.\n9.  **From Sextus:** Genuine kindness. Saw how a family should run – like a good dad runs it. Got the blueprint for living aligned with reality (Nature). Seriousness without being fake. How to genuinely look out for your friends. Patience with people who don\u0027t know stuff or jump to conclusions. He could connect with *anyone*; hanging with him was better than any fake flattery, yet everyone totally respected him. Dude had a knack for figuring out and organizing the core principles for living, smart and methodical. Never saw him lose his temper or get emotional – totally level-headed, but also super caring. Gave props without being loud about it, knew a ton but never showed off.\n10. **From Alexander the Grammar Nerd:** Don\u0027t be that annoying guy always correcting people\u0027s minor mistakes in speaking. If someone messes up a word, don\u0027t jump on them. Just smoothly use the right word yourself in your reply, or focus the conversation back on the actual *point*, not the nitpicky details. Offer correction subtly, if at all.\n11. **From Fronto:** Learned to spot the toxic traits in bad leaders (tyrants) – the envy, the two-faced crap, the hypocrisy. Realized that a lot of the \"elites\" (Patricians) are often seriously lacking in basic human decency and care.\n12. **From Alexander the Platonist:** Don\u0027t constantly tell people \"I\u0027m too busy,\" either in person or writing, unless it\u0027s actually unavoidable. Stop making lame excuses about being \"too busy\" for the basic duties you owe to the people in your life.\n13. **From Catulus:** Don\u0027t brush off a friend\u0027s criticism, even if it seems unfair. Try to get things back on track with them. Speak well of your mentors (like people remembered Domitius and Athenodotus). Genuinely love your kids.\n14. **From my Bro Severus:** Love your family, love truth, love justice. Through him, learned about the real heroes (Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, etc. – guys who stood for principles). Got the idea of a fair society: same rules for everyone, equal rights, freedom of speech, and leaders who prioritize the people\u0027s freedom above all. Also learned from him: consistency in sticking with philosophy, being proactively good, giving freely, staying optimistic, and trusting that your friends actually like you. With him, there was no guessing game – you knew where he stood, especially if he disapproved of someone. Total transparency.\n15. **From Maximus:** Self-mastery, not getting easily distracted. Staying cheerful through everything, even sickness. Having that perfect mix of being approachable/kind and having serious presence/dignity. Doing the job in front of you without whining. Everyone knew he meant what he said and never had hidden agendas. He was never shocked, never rushed, never delayed, never confused or down, never used laughter to hide being pissed off, and wasn\u0027t paranoid or overly emotional. Dude was a machine of doing good deeds, quick to forgive, zero falsehood. He wasn’t someone *trying* to be good; he just *was* fundamentally solid, couldn\u0027t be bent from what\u0027s right. Nobody felt looked down on by him, and nobody dared think they were better. Also had a great sense of humor, used it well.\n16. **From my Adopted Father (Emperor Antoninus Pius):** Observed his chill temper, but absolute rock-solid resolve once he decided something thoughtfully. No ego tied up in titles and honors. Loved the work, kept grinding. Listened carefully to anyone with ideas for the common good. Always fair in giving people what they deserved. Knew from experience when to push hard and when to ease off. Saw he was completely over any weird sexual hang-ups. Didn\u0027t act like he was better than anyone else. Didn’t pressure friends into mandatory dinners or appearances; if they missed something for legit reasons, he treated them exactly the same later. Saw his deep-dive approach to decisions – always investigating fully, never satisfied with first impressions. Loyal to his friends, didn\u0027t get bored of them, but wasn\u0027t overly clingy either. Content in all situations, always positive. Planned ahead, handled details without making a fuss. Shut down fake applause and flattery instantly. Always focused on what the Empire *needed*, managed money responsibly, and took the heat for it patiently. Not superstitious, didn\u0027t try to buy popularity with gifts or pandering. Just sober, firm, never petty or obsessed with novelty. He used the good things life offered (comforts, resources) without arrogance or making excuses – enjoyed them when he had them, didn\u0027t miss them when he didn\u0027t. Nobody could call him a show-off intellectual, a spoiled brat, or a stuffy academic. Everyone saw him as mature, complete, immune to flattery, capable of handling his own shit and everyone else\u0027s. Plus, he respected genuine philosophers but didn\u0027t attack the fakes (or get fooled by them). Easy to talk to, pleasant without being fake. Took reasonable care of his health – not obsessively, not vainly, just enough that he rarely needed doctors. Super willing to yield the spotlight to experts (in law, speaking, ethics, whatever) and helped them get the recognition they deserved. Always followed tradition but without making a show of it. Not restless or flaky – liked stability, routine. Even after bad headaches, bounced right back to work. Kept very few secrets, and only crucial state matters. Prudent and responsible with public spending (games, buildings, donations) – focused on the *need*, not the applause. Didn’t do things at weird times (like bathing). Wasn\u0027t obsessed with building fancy houses, food, clothes, or attractive staff. His style was simple, practical (like his gear from his country villas). Remember that time he calmly handled the annoying tax guy at Tusculum? That was him – never harsh, never holding a grudge, never explosive, never pushed things to a breaking point. He looked at everything piece by piece, like he had all the time in the world, calmly, methodically, strongly, consistently. That famous line about Socrates fit him perfectly: he could enjoy things *or* abstain from them, unlike most guys who either can\u0027t resist or can\u0027t enjoy moderately. Being strong enough for both restraint *and* sober enjoyment? That’s the sign of a truly solid, unbeatable soul – like he showed when Maximus was sick.\n17. **To the Universe/Gods/Fate:** I owe thanks for having awesome grandfathers, parents, sister, teachers, buddies, family, and friends – almost everything good. Also, thanks that I didn’t majorly screw up with any of them, even though I had the potential; circumstances just never pushed me that far (lucky break). Thankful I wasn\u0027t raised longer by my grandpa\u0027s side piece; kept my youthful innocence; didn\u0027t rush into sex, even waited. Thankful I had a ruler and father (Antoninus) who knocked any arrogance out of me and showed me you can live in a palace without needing bodyguards, fancy clothes, or statues everywhere – that a leader can live almost like a regular dude without losing authority or slacking on public duties. Thanks for a brother (Severus) whose character pushed me to keep myself in check, while also being respectful and affectionate. Thankful my kids weren\u0027t born stupid or deformed. Thankful I didn\u0027t get *too* good at rhetoric, poetry, etc. – might have gotten completely lost in them if I\u0027d seen too much early success. Thankful I acted fast to honor my mentors, didn\u0027t put it off. Thankful I knew Apollonius, Rusticus, Maximus. Thankful I got clear, repeated hits on what \"living according to Nature\" actually means – so, as far as the universe and its help goes, nothing stopped me from living that way *right now*, even though I still fall short (my own damn fault for not listening to the hints and instructions). Thankful my body’s held up this long living this kind of demanding life. Thankful I never messed around with Benedicta or Theodotus (dodged those bullets!), and got over past infatuations. Thankful that even when I was pissed at Rusticus, I never did anything I regretted later. Thankful my mom, though she died young, spent her last years with me. Thankful that whenever I wanted to help someone, I was never told \"sorry, no funds\" – and that I never *needed* to take handouts myself. Thankful for my wife – so loyal, loving, and straightforward. Thankful for plenty of good teachers for my kids. Thankful for guidance through dreams (like remedies for spitting blood and dizziness...). Thankful that when I got into philosophy, I didn\u0027t fall for some slick guru, waste time on trivial academic debates, or get lost in pointless theories. All this stuff needs cosmic help and good fortune.\n\n*(Written) Among the Quadi tribe by the Granua river.* (Basically, out on military campaign duty).\n\n---\n\nHow does this feel for capturing the essence of Book 1 in your target \"bro\" style?

      "text": "perfect, now book 2:\nBOOK II\n\n\n\nWritten among the Quadi on the river Gran. I[1]\n\n1. Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet to-day inquisitive, ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All these things have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill. But I, because I have seen that the nature of good is the right, and of ill the wrong, and that the nature of the man himself who does wrong is akin to my own (not of the same blood and seed, but partaking with me in mind, that is in a portion of divinity), I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of upper and lower teeth. To work against one another therefore is to oppose Nature, and to be vexed with another or to turn away from him is to tend to antagonism.\n\n2. This whatever it is that I am, is flesh and vital spirit and the governing self. Disdain the flesh: blood and bones and network, a twisted skein of nerves, veins, arteries. Consider also what the vital spirit is: a current of air, not even continuously the same, but every hour being expelled and sucked in again. There is then a third part, the governing self. Put away your books, be distracted no longer, they are not your portion. Rather, as if on the point of death, reflect like this: \u0027you are an old man, suffer this governing part of you no longer to be in bondage, no longer to be a puppet pulled by selfish impulse, no longer to be indignant with what is allotted in the present or to suspect what is allotted in the future.\u0027\n\n3. The work of the gods is full of Providence: the work of Fortune is not divorced from Nature or the spinning and winding of the threads ordained by Providence. All flows from that other world; and there is, besides, necessity and the wellbeing of the whole universe, whereof you are a part. Now to every part of Nature that is good which the nature of the Whole brings, and which preserves that nature; and the whole world is preserved as much by the changes of the compound bodies as by the changes of the elements which compose those bodies. Let this be sufficient for you, these be continually your doctrines. But put away your thirst for books, that so you may not die murmuring, but truly reconciled and grateful from your heart to the gods.\n\n4. Remember how long you have been putting off these things, and how many times the gods have given you days of grace, and yet you do not use them. Now is it high time to perceive the kind of Universe whereof you are a part and the nature of the governor of the Universe from whom you subsist as an effluence, and that the term of your time is circumscribed, and that unless you use it to attain calm of mind, time will be gone and you will be gone and the opportunity to use it will not be yours again.\n\n5. Each hour be minded, valiantly as becomes a Roman and a man, to do what is to your hand, with precise . . . and unaffected dignity, natural love, freedom and justice; and to give yourself repose from every other imagination. And so you will, if only you do each act as though it were your last, freed from every random aim, from wilful turning away from the directing Reason, from pretence, self-love and displeasure with what is allotted to you. You see how few things a man need master in order to live a smooth and godfearing life; for the gods themselves will require nothing more of him who keeps these precepts.\n\n6. You are doing yourself violence, violence, my soul; and you will have no second occasion to do yourself honour. Brief is the life of each of us, and this of yours is nearly ended, and yet you do not reverence yourself, but commit your well-being to the charge of other men\u0027s souls.\n\n7. Do things from outside break in to distract you? Give yourself a time of quiet to learn some new good thing and cease to wander out of your course. But, when you have done that, be on your guard against a second kind of wandering. For those who are sick to death in life, with no mark on which they direct every impulse or in general every imagination, are triflers, not in words only but also in their deeds.\n\n8. Men are not easily seen to be brought into evil case by failure to consider what passes in another\u0027s soul; but they who do not read aright the motions of their own soul are bound to be in evil case.\n\n9. Always remember the following: what the nature of the Whole is; what my own nature; the relation of this nature to that; what kind of part it is of what kind of Whole; and that no man can hinder your saying and doing at all times what is in accordance with that Nature whereof you are a part.\n\n10. Like a true philosopher Theophrastus says, when comparing, as men commonly do compare, various faults, that errors of appetite are graver than errors of temper. For clearly one who loses his temper is turning away from Reason with a kind of pain and inward spasm; whereas he who offends through appetite is the victim of pleasure and is clearly more vicious in a way and more effeminate in his wrong-doing. Rightly then and in a truly philosophic spirit Theophrastus said that an offence attended with pleasure involves greater censure than one attended with pain. And, generally, the latter resembles more a man who was originally wronged and so is forced by pain to lose his temper; the other has begun it himself and has been impelled to do wrong, carried away by appetite to do what he does.\n\n11. In the conviction that it is possible you may depart from life at once, act and speak and think in every case accordingly. But to leave the company of men is nothing to fear, if gods exist; for they would not involve you in ill. If, however, they do not exist or if they take no care for man\u0027s affairs, why should I go on living in a world void of gods, or void of providence? But they do exist, and they do care for men\u0027s lives, and they have put it entirely in a man\u0027s power not to fall into real ills; for the rest, if anything were an ill, they would have provided also for this, that it may be in every man\u0027s power not to fall into it; (and how could what does not make a man worse make his life worse?)[2] But the nature of the Whole would not have winked at these things either out of ignorance or because (though it knew of them) it had not the power to guard against them or to put them right; neither would it have made so vast an error, from want of power or skill, as to permit good and ill to befall indifferently, both good and bad men equally. Now death, and life, good report and evil report, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty, these all befall men, good and bad alike, equally, and are themselves neither right nor wrong:[2] they are therefore neither good nor ill.\n\n12. How all things are vanishing swiftly, bodies themselves in the Universe and the memorials of them in Time; what is the character of all the things of sense, and most of all those which attract by the bait of pleasure or terrify by the threat of pain or are shouted abroad by vanity, how cheap, contemptible, soiled, corruptible, and mortal:—these are for the faculty of mind to consider. To consider too what kind of men those are whose judgements and voices confer honour and dishonour; what it is to die, and that if a man looks at it by itself and by the separating activity of thought strips off all the images associated with death, he will come to judge it to be nothing else but Nature\u0027s handiwork. But if a man fears Nature\u0027s handiwork he is a mere child; and yet death is not merely Nature\u0027s handiwork, but also her well-being. To consider also how mortal man touches God and through what organ of himself, and when that part of him is in what sort of condition.\n\n13. Nothing is more wretched than the man who goes round and round everything, and, as Pindar says, \u0027searches the bowels of the earth\u0027, and seeks by conjecture to sound the minds of his neighbours, but fails to perceive that it is enough to abide with the Divinity that is within himself and to do Him genuine service. Now that service is to keep Him unsullied by passion, trifling, and discontent with what comes from God or men. What comes from the Gods is to be revered because of excellence; what comes from men is dear because they are of one kindred with himself; pitiful too sometimes, humanly speaking, by reason of their ignorance of good and ill. This disablement is more grievous than that which robs the eyes of the power to distinguish light from darkness.\n\n14. Even were you about to live three thousand years or thrice ten thousand, nevertheless remember this, that no one loses any other life than this which he is living, nor lives any other than this which he is losing. Thus the longest and the shortest come to the same thing. For the present is equal for all, and what is passing is therefore equal: thus what is being lost is proved to be barely a moment. For a man could lose neither past nor future; how can one rob him of what he has not got? Always remember, then, these two things: one, that all things from everlasting are of the same kind, and are in rotation; and it matters nothing whether it be for a hundred years or for two hundred or for an infinite time that a man shall behold the same spectacle; the other, that the longest-lived and the soonest to die have an equal loss; for it is the present alone of which either will be deprived, since (as we saw) this is all he has and a man does not lose what he has not got.\n\n15. \u0027Everything is what you judge it to be.\u0027 While the retort made to the Cynic philosopher Monimus is plain enough, plain too is the use of the saying, if one only take the gist of it, so far as it is true.\n\n16. The soul of a man does violence to itself, first and foremost when it becomes so far as in it lies, a separate growth, a blain as it were upon the Universe. For to turn against anything that comes to pass is a separation from Nature, by which the natures of each of the rest are severally comprehended. Secondly, when it turns away from any human being or is swept counter to him, meaning to injure him, as is the case with the natures of those who are enraged. It violates itself, thirdly, when it is the victim of pleasure or pain; fourthly, when it acts a part, and says or does anything both feignedly and falsely. Fifthly, when, failing to direct any act or impulse of its own upon a mark, it behaves in any matter without a plan or conscious purpose, whereas even the smallest act ought to have a reference to the end. Now the end of reasonable creatures is this: to obey the rule and ordinance of the most venerable of all cities and governments.\n\n17. Of man\u0027s life, his time is a point, his existence a flux, his sensation clouded, his body\u0027s entire composition corruptible, his vital spirit an eddy of breath, his fortune hard to predict, his fame uncertain. Briefly, all the things of the body, a river; all the things of the spirit, dream and delirium; his life a warfare and a sojourn in a strange land, his after-fame oblivion. What then can be his escort through life? One thing and one thing only, Philosophy. And this is to keep the spirit within him unwronged and unscathed, master of pains and pleasures, doing nothing at random, nothing falsely and with pretence; needing no other to do aught or to leave aught undone; and moreover accepting what befalls it, that is, what is assigned to it, as coming from that other world from which it came itself. And in all things awaiting death, with a mind that is satisfied, counting it nothing else than a release of the elements from which each living creature is composed. Now if there is no hurt to the elements themselves in their ceaseless changing each into other, why should a man apprehend anxiously the change and dissolution of them all? For this is according to Nature; and no evil is according to Nature.",

      "text": "Here\u0027s a thinking process that could lead to the \"bro version\" of Meditations Book 2:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants a \"bro version\" of Marcus Aurelius\u0027s Meditations, Book 2, following the style established with the Enchiridion and Meditations Book 1. This means:\n    *   Modern, informal language (\"dude,\" \"crap,\" \"BS\").\n    *   Focus on actionable advice and core concepts.\n    *   Cutting through philosophical jargon where possible, replacing it with direct, relatable terms.\n    *   Maintaining the seriousness and depth of the original message, just presenting it differently.\n    *   Using the established \"voice\" – practical, a bit blunt, grounded, encouraging self-reliance and mental toughness.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Source Text (Book 2):** Read through the original Book 2 section by section, identifying the key message of each point.\n\n    *   **Section 1:** Morning prep talk. Expect jerks. They\u0027re ignorant. *I* know right/wrong. They\u0027re like me (part divine/rational). Can\u0027t *truly* harm me (my inner self). Can\u0027t be mad; we\u0027re meant to work together like body parts. Fighting each other is unnatural.\n    *   **Section 2:** What am I? Body (flesh, bones – dismiss it), Breath/Spirit (temporary air), Mind/Governing Self (the real deal). Ditch distractions (books). You\u0027re old, dying soon. Stop letting your mind be a slave to impulse or worry about present/future external events.\n    *   **Section 3:** Gods\u0027 work \u003d Providence/Order. Fortune isn\u0027t random, it\u0027s tied to Nature/Providence. Everything flows from this order. Necessity exists. You\u0027re part of the Universe. What\u0027s good for the Whole (Nature) is good for the part (you). Change preserves the Whole. Accept this. Ditch book-thirst; die reconciled, grateful.\n    *   **Section 4:** Reminder: You keep procrastinating on self-improvement. Gods gave you chances. Time\u0027s running out. Realize your place in the Universe and your connection to its Governor. Use your limited time to get inner peace, or it\u0027s gone forever.\n    *   **Section 5:** Hourly reminder: Act like a Roman/man – do the task at hand precisely, with dignity, love, freedom, justice. No distractions. Do each act like it\u0027s your last – no randomness, no ego, no complaining about your lot. Master these few things for a smooth, god-fearing life. Gods ask no more.\n    *   **Section 6:** Soul, you\u0027re hurting yourself! No second chances to live honorably. Life\u0027s short, almost over. Respect yourself; stop putting your well-being in others\u0027 hands/opinions.\n    *   **Section 7:** External distractions? Take quiet time to learn something good. Stop drifting. But beware another drift: aimlessness. People without a clear goal in life are just messing around, even if busy.\n    *   **Section 8:** Not understanding others\u0027 minds causes fewer problems than not understanding *your own* mind. Know yourself first.\n    *   **Section 9:** Core reminders: Nature of the Whole? My nature? My relation to the Whole? My role as a part? Nobody can stop me from acting/speaking according to my nature/role.\n    *   **Section 10:** Theophrastus quote: Giving in to *desire* is worse than losing your *temper*. Temper \u003d reaction to pain/Reason fighting back. Desire \u003d choosing pleasure over Reason, weaker, more deliberate vice. Pleasure-based wrongdoing is worse than pain-based (reactive) wrongdoing.\n    *   **Section 11:** Live like you could die any minute. Don\u0027t fear death if gods exist (they won\u0027t harm you). If no gods/they don\u0027t care, why live in a godless world? BUT they *do* exist and care. They put true harm (inner corruption) in our control. External \"ills\" aren\u0027t *real* ills (they don\u0027t make *you* worse). Nature wouldn\u0027t allow good/bad externals to fall randomly on good/bad people if they were *truly* good/evil. Death, life, reputation, pain, pleasure, wealth, poverty – happen to all, aren\u0027t inherently right/wrong, therefore not truly good/evil.\n    *   **Section 12:** Everything vanishes quickly (bodies, memories). Sensory stuff (pleasure bait, pain threats, vanity) is cheap, dirty, temporary, dead. Your mind needs to see this. Consider who judges you. What is death? Strip away the scary stories; it\u0027s just Nature\u0027s process. Fearing Nature \u003d childish. Death is natural *and* part of Nature\u0027s well-being. How do we connect to the Divine? Through which part? When is that part ready?\n    *   **Section 13:** Most miserable: Guy obsessed with externals, spying on neighbors\u0027 thoughts (Pindar quote). Just focus on the Divinity *within* you. Serve it genuinely: keep it clean from passion, pettiness, complaining about Fate/people. Respect divine stuff (it\u0027s excellent); love human stuff (kinship), pity their ignorance (worse than blindness).\n    *   **Section 14:** Even if you lived forever, you only lose the *present* moment when you die. Long life vs. short life \u003d same loss (the present). Past/future aren\u0027t yours to lose. Two reminders: 1) Everything repeats eternally. Seeing the same show for 100 vs 200 years makes no difference. 2) Longest/shortest life lose the same thing: the present, the only thing they truly possess.\n    *   **Section 15:** \"Everything is opinion/judgment.\" (Monimus the Cynic). Useful idea if you get the gist: your *perception* shapes your reality.\n    *   **Section 16:** How the soul harms itself: 1) Becoming a tumor on the Universe (fighting reality/Nature). 2) Turning against others with intent to harm (anger). 3) Being controlled by pleasure/pain. 4) Being fake (acting/speaking falsely). 5) Acting without purpose/goal (even small things need direction). Goal for rational beings: Follow the rules of the ultimate City/Government (Reason/Cosmos).\n    *   **Section 17:** Life\u0027s details: Time\u003dpoint, existence\u003dflow, senses\u003ddim, body\u003ddecaying, spirit\u003dwhirlwind, fortune\u003dunpredictable, fame\u003dforgotten. Body stuff \u003d river. Mind stuff \u003d dream. Life \u003d war/journey. Fame \u003d oblivion. What helps? Only Philosophy. This means: keeping your inner spirit unharmed, master of pain/pleasure, acting deliberately (no randomness, fakeness), needing nothing external, accepting fate as coming from the Source, awaiting death calmly as just element rearrangement. If elements changing isn\u0027t bad, why fear *your* change/dissolution? It\u0027s natural. Nothing natural is evil.\n\n3.  **Translate Section by Section into the \"Bro Voice\":** Apply the style guidelines identified in step 1 to the key messages from step 2.\n\n    *   **Sec 1:** Start strong, morning mindset. \"Wake up and tell yourself...\" List the negative traits directly.

      "text": "Okay, let\u0027s dive into Book 2 with that same direct, no-nonsense style.\n\n---\n\n**Meditations: Book 2 - The Bro Version**\n\n*(Written out near the Gran river, probably freezing my ass off with the Quadi tribe nearby)*\n\n1.  **Morning Pep Talk: Dealing with Assholes**\n    Wake up and tell yourself: Today I\u0027m gonna run into people who are nosy, ungrateful, arrogant, sneaky, jealous, and downright unpleasant. They\u0027re like this because they\u0027re clueless about what\u0027s actually good and bad. But *I* get it. I\u0027ve seen the beauty of Right and the ugliness of Wrong. I also see that the dude doing wrong is fundamentally built like me – not blood-related, but we share the same basic wiring, that spark of the divine (Reason). Because of that, none of them can *truly* mess with me, because nobody can force me to be a shitty person. And I can\u0027t stay pissed at my own kin or hate them. We\u0027re all here to work together, like feet, hands, eyelids, or rows of teeth. Getting in each other\u0027s way is totally unnatural. Getting annoyed or turning your back on someone? That\u0027s basically declaring war on the team.\n\n2.  **Know Thyself (The Core Components)**\n    This thing I call \u0027me\u0027? It\u0027s basically three parts: Meat-sack (flesh), Spark (vital breath/spirit), and the Boss (your mind, the Governing Self). Forget the meat-sack – just blood, bones, a tangled mess of nerves and tubes. The spark? Just air, constantly cycling in and out, never the same. The third part, the Boss – *that\u0027s* the key. Ditch the books for a sec, stop getting distracted, that stuff isn\u0027t the real you. Think like you\u0027re dying right now: You\u0027re an old man. Stop letting your Boss-mind be a slave. Stop letting it get jerked around by selfish whims like a puppet. Stop bitching about your current situation or worrying about the future.\n\n3.  **Trust the Process (Gods, Fortune, Nature)**\n    The work of the Gods (or the Universe, whatever) is driven by pure Order (Providence). Even random shit (Fortune) isn\u0027t totally separate from Nature or the grand plan woven by that Order. It all flows from that source. Plus, there\u0027s Necessity, and it all contributes to the well-being of the whole damn universe, which you\u0027re a part of. Here’s the deal: what\u0027s good for the whole system (Nature) is good for *you*, the part. And the system stays healthy through constant change – things combining, breaking down, elements shifting. Let that be enough for you. Make these your core beliefs. And seriously, ditch the desperate need to read *everything*. Aim to die without whining, genuinely chill and thankful to the powers that be.\n\n4.  **Stop Procrastinating, Clock\u0027s Ticking**\n    Dude, remember how long you\u0027ve been putting this self-improvement shit off? How many extra days the Gods (or Fate) have given you, and you *still* haven\u0027t used them? It\u0027s way past time to realize what kind of Universe you\u0027re in, who\u0027s running the show (the Governor you stem from), and that your time here is limited. If you don\u0027t use this time to get your head straight and find inner peace, the clock runs out, *you* run out, and the chance is gone. Forever.\n\n5.  **Hourly Check-In: Act Right**\n    Every single hour, commit – like a solid Roman, like a real man – to doing the task right in front of you. Do it with precision, real dignity (no faking), genuine kindness, freedom, and justice. And give yourself a break from all other distracting thoughts. You *can* do this, IF you tackle each action as if it were your absolute last. Free from random goals, free from willfully ignoring Reason, free from pretending, free from self-obsession, and free from bitching about what life hands you. See? It\u0027s just a few key things you need to nail to live a smooth, decent life. The Gods themselves wouldn\u0027t ask for more than this.\n\n6.  **Stop Self-Sabotage**\n    Yo, Soul! You\u0027re doing violence to yourself, man! Real violence! And you won\u0027t get a second shot at honoring yourself properly. Life\u0027s short for everyone, and yours is almost done. Show some self-respect already! Stop putting your well-being and happiness in the hands (or minds) of other people.\n\n7.  **Focus! Ditch Distractions \u0026 Aimlessness**\n    Is outside stuff constantly pulling you off track? Carve out some quiet time to learn something genuinely good and stop drifting aimlessly. But watch out for another trap: being busy but having no real *point*. Those people who are dead inside while alive, with no clear target for their efforts or thoughts? They\u0027re just screwing around, wasting time with actions as much as words.\n\n8.  **Know Your Own Mind First**\n    You rarely see people truly screwed over just because they didn\u0027t obsess about what\u0027s going on in someone else\u0027s head. But people who don\u0027t accurately track the movements and state of their *own* mind? They are absolutely *guaranteed* to be screwed. Know yourself first.\n\n9.  **Core Reminders: Keep These Handy**\n    Always remember:\n    *   What\u0027s the Nature of the Big Picture (the Whole)?\n    *   What\u0027s *my* nature?\n    *   How does my nature relate to the Big Picture?\n    *   What kind of part am I, of what kind of Whole?\n    *   *Nobody* can stop you from saying and doing what aligns with the Nature you\u0027re part of.\n\n10. **Temper vs. Appetite: Which is Worse?**\n    My man Theophrastus hit it on the head when comparing screw-ups: Giving in to your *appetites* (desires) is worse than losing your *temper*. Think about it: the angry guy is fighting Reason, feeling pain, spasming internally. The guy chasing pleasure (appetite) is willingly seduced, acting more deliberately weak and kinda pathetic in his wrongdoing. So yeah, Theophrastus was right, philosophically speaking: doing wrong for pleasure deserves more blame than doing wrong out of reactive pain. One guy feels wronged and snaps; the other *starts* the problem, letting desire pull him into screwing up.\n\n11. **Facing Death \u0026 What\u0027s Truly Bad**\n    Act, speak, and think *always* as if you could check out any minute. Leaving humanity? No big deal if Gods exist – they wouldn\u0027t let real harm touch you. If they don\u0027t exist, or don\u0027t care? Then why bother living in a world without gods or providence? But listen: they *do* exist, they *do* care about us, and they put it entirely in *our* power to avoid *real* harm (i.e., becoming a bad person). As for everything else? If something external was *truly* bad, they\u0027d have made sure we could all avoid it. (And how can something that doesn\u0027t make *you* a worse person make your *life* worse?) The fundamental Nature of the Universe wouldn\u0027t overlook this stuff out of ignorance, or lack the power to fix it. It wouldn\u0027t make such a massive blunder as letting supposed \u0027goods\u0027 and \u0027ills\u0027 fall randomly on good and bad people alike. Stuff like death, life, fame, shame, pain, pleasure, wealth, poverty – these hit everyone, good or bad. They aren\u0027t inherently right or wrong. Therefore, they are neither truly good nor truly bad.\n\n12. **Seeing Things Clearly (Transience, Death)**\n    Notice how fast everything vanishes? Physical bodies disappear into the Universe, memories fade in Time. Think about sensory stuff – especially things that lure you with pleasure or scare you with pain, or get hyped up by vanity. How cheap, pathetic, dirty, breakable, and ultimately dead it all is. That\u0027s a job for your reasoning mind. Also, consider: what kind of people are these whose opinions grant \u0027honor\u0027? What *is* death? Look at it directly. Mentally strip away all the bullshit stories we attach to it. You\u0027ll see it\u0027s nothing but Nature doing its thing. If you fear Nature\u0027s work, you\u0027re just a child. And death isn\u0027t just Nature\u0027s work; it\u0027s part of its *well-being*. Also, think about how we mortals connect with the Divine/God – through what part of us? And when is that part of us in the right state for it?\n\n13. **Focus Inward, Not Outward**\n    Nothing\u0027s more pathetic than the guy constantly running around, trying to figure out everything external, \u0027searching the bowels of the earth\u0027 (like Pindar said), guessing what neighbors think. Dude, chill. It\u0027s *enough* to stick with the Divinity *inside* you and serve it honestly. That service means keeping your inner self clean from emotional freak-outs, pointless distractions, and whining about what comes from Gods or other people. Respect what comes from the Gods (it\u0027s excellent). Love what comes from humans (we\u0027re kin). Pity them sometimes too, for their ignorance of good and evil – that ignorance is a worse handicap than being physically blind.\n\n14. **The Only Time You Have is Now**\n    Even if you were gonna live 3,000 or 30,000 years, remember this: nobody loses any life other than the one they\u0027re living *right now*. Nobody lives any other life than the one they\u0027re losing *right now*. So, the longest life and the shortest life basically amount to the same thing in terms of loss. Why? Because the *present* moment is the same for everyone. What\u0027s passing is the same. So what you lose is just a tiny blip. You can\u0027t lose the past (it\u0027s gone) or the future (it ain\u0027t here yet). How can someone take what you don\u0027t have? So, two key takeaways: 1) Everything repeats eternally, like reruns. Doesn\u0027t matter if you watch the same show for 100 years, 200, or infinity. 2) The guy who lives longest and the guy who dies earliest lose exactly the same thing: the present moment. Because that\u0027s all anyone ever truly *has*, and you can\u0027t lose what you don\u0027t possess.\n\n15. **Perception is Reality (Mostly)**\n    \"Everything is what you judge it to be.\" That comeback to Monimus the Cynic is obvious, yeah. But the saying itself is useful, if you grab the core truth: Your *perception* shapes your experience.\n\n16. **How Your Soul Screws Itself Over**\n    A person\u0027s soul messes itself up, most fundamentally, when:\n    1.  It isolates itself, becoming like a tumor on the Universe. Fighting reality, rebelling against what happens – that\u0027s cutting yourself off from the Nature that connects everything.\n    2.  It turns against another person or pushes against them with the intent to harm (like when people get enraged).\n    3.  It lets itself be controlled by pleasure or pain.\n    4.  It acts fake, saying or doing things falsely or with pretense.\n    5.  It acts without a clear goal or conscious purpose, just flailing randomly. Even the smallest actions should aim towards the ultimate End. And the End for rational beings? To follow the rules and order of the most awesome City and Government (Reason, the Cosmos).\n\n17. **Life\u0027s Breakdown \u0026 The Only Lifeline**\n    Quick rundown of human life: Time \u003d a blink. Existence \u003d a river flowing away. Senses \u003d unreliable, cloudy. Body \u003d constantly decaying junk. Spirit \u003d a chaotic swirl. Fortune \u003d unpredictable. Fame \u003d quickly forgotten. Sum up: Body stuff is like a river, gone. Mind stuff is like a dream, hazy. Life itself is a battle, a brief stay in a foreign land. Afterlife fame? Oblivion. So what the hell can guide us through? One thing and one thing only: Philosophy. Real philosophy means: keeping your inner spirit unharmed and untouched, master of pains and pleasures, doing nothing randomly, nothing fake; not needing others to do (or not do) things for your well-being; accepting what happens (your assigned lot) as coming from the same Source you came from. And through it all, calmly waiting for death, seeing it as just a release of the elements that make up every living thing. If the elements themselves aren\u0027t harmed by constantly changing into each other, why should *you* freak out about the change and breakdown of *your* elements? It\u0027s natural. And nothing natural is truly evil.\n\n---\n\nThere\u0027s Book 2! Let me know when you\u0027re ready for the next round.",

      "text": "BOOK III\n\nWritten in Carnuntum[1]\n\n1. We ought to take into account not only the fact that day by day life is being spent and a smaller balance remaining, but this further point also that, should we live longer, it is at least doubtful whether the intellect will hereafter be the same, still sufficient to comprehend events and the speculation which contributes to the understanding alike of things divine and human. For, if the mind begin to decay, there will be no failure of functions like transpiration, nutrition, sense-impression, and desire; but the right employment of ourselves, precision in regard to the related elements of duty, analysis of the indications of sense, to know just whether the time is come to take leave of life, and all questions of the kind which specially require a trained judgement,—these are extinguished before the rest. Accordingly we must press forward, not only because every day we are drawing nearer to death, but also because the apprehension of events and the ability to adapt ourselves to them begin to wane before the end.\n\n2. We must also observe closely points of this kind, that even the secondary effects of Nature\u0027s processes possess a sort of grace and attraction. To take one instance, bread when it is being baked breaks open at some places; now even these cracks, which in one way contradict the promise of the baker\u0027s art, somehow catch the eye and stimulate in a special way our appetite for the food. And again figs, when fully mature, gape, and in ripe olives their very approach to decay adds a certain beauty of its own to the fruit. Ears of corn too when they bend downwards, the lion\u0027s wrinkled brow, the foam flowing ​from the boar\u0027s mouth, and many other characteristics that are far from beautiful if we look at them in isolation, do nevertheless because they follow from Nature\u0027s processes lend those a further ornament and a fascination. And so, if a man has a feeling for, and a deeper insight into the processes of the Universe, there is hardly one but will somehow appear to present itself pleasantly to him, even among mere attendant circumstances. Such a man also will feel no less pleasure in looking at the actual jaws of wild beasts than at the imitations which painters and sculptors exhibit, and he will be enabled to see in an old woman or an old man a kind of freshness and bloom, and to look upon the charms of his own boy slaves with sober eyes. And many such experiences there will be, not convincing to every one but occurring to him and to him alone who has become genuinely familiar with Nature and her works.\n\n3. Hippocrates, after curing many sicknesses, himself fell sick and died. The Chaldean astrologers foretold the death of many persons, then the hour of fate overtook them also. Alexander, Pompeius, and Julius Caesar, after so often utterly destroying whole towns and slaying in the field many myriads of horse and foot, themselves also one day departed from life. Heraclitus, after many speculations about the fire which should consume the Universe, was waterlogged by dropsy, poulticed himself with cow-dung and died. Vermin killed Democritus; another kind of vermin Socrates. What is the moral? You went on board, you set sail, you have made the port. Step ashore: if to a second life, nothing is void of gods, not even in that other world; but if to unconsciousness, you will cease to suffer pains and pleasures and to be the servant of an earthly vessel as far inferior as that which ​does it service is superior; for the one is mind and deity, the other clay and gore.\n\n4. Do not waste the balance of life left to you in thoughts about other persons, when you are not referring to some advantage of your fellows—for why do you rob yourself of something else which you might do—,[2] I mean if you imagine to yourself what so and so is doing, and why; what he is saying or thinking or planning, and every thought of the kind which leads you astray from close watch over your governing self?\n\nRather you must, in the train of your thoughts, avoid what is merely casual and without purpose, and above all curiosity and malice; you must habituate yourself only to thoughts about which if some one were suddenly to ask: \u0027What is in your mind now?\u0027, you would at once reply, quite frankly, this or that; and so from the answer it would immediately be plain that all was simplicity and kindness, the thoughts of a social being, who disregards pleasurable, or to speak more generally luxurious imaginings or rivalry of any kind, or envy and suspicion or anything else about which you would blush to put into words that you had it in your head.\n\nA man so minded, putting off no longer to be one of the elect, is surely a priest and minister of gods, employing aright that which is seated within him, which makes the mere mortal to be unstained by pleasures, unscathed by any pain, untouched by any wrong, unconscious of any wickedness; a wrestler in the greatest contest of all, not to be overthrown by any passion; dyed with justice to the core, welcoming with his whole heart all that comes to pass and is assigned to him; seldom and only under some great necessity and for the common good imagining what ​another person is saying or doing or thinking. For he has only his own work to realize and he keeps in mind continually what is assigned to him from the Whole;—his work he makes perfect, his lot he is convinced is good; for the birth-spirit assigned to every man goes with him and carries him along with it.\n\nMoreover, he remembers that all reasonable beings are akin to himself, and that although to care for all men is in accord with man\u0027s nature, he is to cling not to the opinion of all men, but only of men who live in accord with Nature. Indeed, he remembers continually what those who do not so live are like, in their homes and abroad, by night and by day; what manner of men they are, and those with whom they defile themselves. Therefore he takes no account even of the praise of such men,—men who are not even acceptable to themselves.\n\n5. Do not act unwillingly nor selfishly nor without self-examination, nor with divergent motives. Let no affectation veneer your thinking. Be neither a busy talker, nor a busybody. Moreover let the God within be the guardian of a real man, a man of ripe years, a statesman, a Roman, a magistrate, who has taken his post like one waiting for the Retreat to sound, ready to depart, needing no oath nor any man as witness. And see that you have gladness of face, no need of service from without nor the peace that other men bestow. You should stand upright, not be held upright.\n\n6. If you discover in the life of man something higher than justice, truth, temperance, fortitude, and generally speaking than your understanding contented with itself, where it presents you behaving by the rule of right, and satisfied with destiny, in what is assigned to you and is ​not yours to choose; if, I say, you see something higher than this, turn to it with all your heart and enjoy the supreme good now that it is found. But if nothing higher is revealed than the very divinity seated within you, subordinating your private impulses to itself, examining your thoughts, having withdrawn itself, as Socrates used to say, from the sense-affections, and subordinated itself to the gods and making men its first care; if you find all else to be smaller and cheaper than this, give no room to anything else, to which when once you incline and turn, you will no longer have the power without a struggle to prefer in honour that which is your own, your peculiar good. For it is not right to set up a rival of another kind to the good of Reason and of the Commonwealth; the praise of the multitude, for example, or place or wealth or pleasurable indulgence. All these, though they appear for a little while to be in accord, suddenly gain the mastery and carry a man away. Do you then, I say, simply and of your own free will, choose the higher and hold fast to that. \u0027But the higher is what is to our advantage\u0027; if to the advantage of a reasonable being, keep hold of that, but if to the advantage of a mere animate creature, say so and preserve your decision without parade; only see to it that you make a choice that will not betray you.\n\n7. Never value as an advantage to yourself what will force you one day to break your word, to abandon self-respect, to hate, suspect, execrate another, to act a part, to covet anything that calls for walls or coverings to conceal it. A man who puts first his own mind and divinity, and the holy rites of its excellence, makes no scene, utters no groans, will need neither the refuge of solitude nor the crowded streets. What is most worth while, he will pass his days neither in pursuit nor in avoidance, and it is no concern at all of his whether the time be longer or shorter for which he shall have the use of the soul in its bodily ​envelope; for even if he must be released at once, he will depart as easily as he would perform any other act that can be done with reverence and sobriety, being careful all his life of this one thing alone that his understanding be not found in any state which is foreign to a reasonable social being.\n\n8. In the understanding of a man of chastened and purified spirit you will find, no trace of festering wound, no ulceration, no abscess beneath the skin. The hour of fate does not surprise his life before its fulfilment, so that one would say that the actor is leaving the stage before he has fulfilled his role, before the play is over. You will find nothing servile or artificial, no dependence on others nor severance from them; nothing to account for, nothing that needs a hole to hide in.\n\n9. Reverence your faculty of judgement. On this it entirely rests that your governing self no longer has a judgement disobedient to Nature and to the estate of a reasonable being. This judgement promises deliberateness, familiar friendship with men, and to follow in the train of the gods.\n\n10. Therefore throw all else aside, and hold fast only these few things; further calling to mind at the same time that each of us lives only in the present, this brief moment; the rest is either a life that is past, or is in an uncertain future. Little the life each lives, little the corner of the earth he lives in, little even the longest fame hereafter, and even that dependent on a succession of poor mortals, who will very soon be dead, and have not learnt to know themselves, much less the man who was dead long years ago.\n\n11. To the above supports let one more be added. Always make a figure or outline of the imagined object as it occurs, in order to see distinctly what it is in its essence, naked, as a whole and parts; and say to yourself its individual name and the names of the things of which it was compounded and into which it will be broken up. For nothing is so able to create greatness of mind as the power methodically and truthfully to test each thing that meets one in life, and always to look upon it so as to attend ​at the same time to the use which this particular thing contributes to a Universe of a certain definite kind, what value it has in reference to the Whole, and what to man, who is a citizen of the highest City, whereof all other cities are like households. What is this which now creates an image in me, what is its composition? how long will it naturally continue, what virtue is of use to meet it; for example, gentleness, fortitude, truth, good faith, simplicity, self-reliance, and the rest? Therefore, in each case, we must say: this has come from God; this by the actual co-ordination of events, the complicated web and similar coincidence or chance; this again from my fellow man, my kinsman, my comrade, yet one who does not know what is natural for himself. But I do know; wherefore I use him kindly and justly, according to the natural law of fellowship, aiming, however, at the same time at his desert, where the question is morally indifferent.\n\n12. If you complete the present work, following the rule of right, earnestly, with all your might, with kindness, and admit no side issue, but preserve your own divinity pure and erect, as if you have this moment to restore it; if you make this secure, expecting nothing and avoiding nothing, but content with present action in accord with Nature and with heroic truth in what you mean and say, you will live the blessed life. Now there is no one who is able to prevent this.\n\n13. As doctors have their instruments and scalpels always at hand to meet sudden demands for treatment, so do you have your doctrines ready in order to recognize the divine and human, and so to do everything, even the very smallest, as mindful of the bond which unites the divine and human; for you will not do any act well which concerns man without referring it to the divine; and the same is true of your conduct to God.\n\n14. Do not wander from your path any longer, for you ​are not likely to read your note-books or your deeds of ancient Rome and Greece or your extracts from their writings, which you laid up against old age. Hasten then to the goal, lay idle hopes aside, and come to your own help, if you care at all for yourself, while still you may.\n\n15. They have not learnt to know the manifold significance of theft, of sowing, of buying, resting, seeing what ought to be done. This depends not on the bodily eye but on another kind of vision.\n\n16. Body, vital spirit, mind: of the body, sense perceptions; of the vital spirit, impulses; of the mind, doctrines. To be impressed by images belongs also to the beasts of the field, to be swayed by the strings of impulse to wild beasts, to men who sin against nature, to a Phalaris or a Nero. To have the mind as guide to what appear to be duties belongs also to men who do not believe in gods, who betray their own country, who do anything and everything once they have locked their doors. If then all else is common to you with those whom I have mentioned, it remains the peculiar mark of the good man to love and welcome what befalls him and is the thread fate spins for him; not to soil the divinity seated within his breast nor to disquiet it with a mob of imaginations, but to preserve and to propitiate it, following God in orderly wise, uttering no word contrary to truth, doing no act contrary to justice. And if all men disbelieve that he lives simply, modestly, and cheerfully, he is not angry with any one of them nor diverted from the road that leads to the goal of his life, at which he must arrive, pure, peaceful, ready to depart, in effortless accord with his own birth-spirit.\n\n",

Don\u0027t wait.\n*   **Section 2 (Beauty in Imperfection):** Find the cool details even in \u0027flaws\u0027 or decay. See the bigger picture. Appreciate the weird beauty in natural processes.\n*   **Section 3 (Mortality Examples):** Famous dudes died too. Get over yourself. Life is short, make port, be ready for whatever\u0027s next (or nothing).\n*   **Section 4 (Mind Your Business):** Stop wasting time worrying about others unless it\u0027s *constructive*. Focus inward. Be transparent and decent in your thoughts. Be a good dude, connected to the Whole, doing your job. Ignore haters.\n*   **Section 5 (Inner Strength):** Act willingly, thoughtfully, without ulterior motives. No fake personas. Be a solid, mature leader guided by inner reason. Stand tall on your own.\n*   **Section 6 (Finding the Highest Good):** If you find something better than Reason/Virtue, go for it. But spoiler: you won\u0027t. Prioritize your inner \u0027divinity\u0027/Reason over fleeting external stuff (praise, wealth, pleasure). Stick to what truly benefits your rational self.\n*   **Section 7 (Integrity \u0026 Detachment):** Never trade your integrity for short-term gain. A good person needs no hiding places, no drama. They face life openly, ready to leave whenever, focused only on keeping their mind right.\n*   **Section 8 (Inner Purity):** A truly good person has no inner corruption, no hidden wounds. Fate doesn\u0027t catch them unprepared. They leave life cleanly, like an actor finishing their part. No fakeness, no dependency, nothing to hide.\n*   **Section 9 (Reverence for Judgement):** Your judgment faculty is key. Keep it aligned with Nature and Reason. It leads to clarity, good relationships, and harmony with the divine.\n*   **Section 10 (Brevity of Life \u0026 Fame):** Life is now, just this moment. The rest is gone or unknown. Your life, your world, your fame are tiny and fleeting. Get perspective.\n*   **Section 11 (Analyzing Impressions):** Break down everything you encounter. Ask: What is it? What\u0027s it made of? How long will it last? What virtue do I need? Where did it come from (God/Fate/Fellow Human)? Deal with others justly, aim for their true good.\n*   **Section 12 (The Blessed Life Formula):** Do the present task right, seriously, kindly, focused, keeping your inner self pure, expecting nothing, fearing nothing, content with acting naturally and truthfully. That\u0027s the win. Nobody can stop you.\n*   **Section 13 (Ready Doctrines):** Keep your principles handy like a surgeon\u0027s tools. Use them to understand everything (divine/human connection) and act accordingly, even in small things. Connect human actions to the divine perspective.\n*   **Section 14 (Stop Reading, Start Doing):** Quit delaying by rereading old notes or histories. The goal is *now*. Help yourself *now*. Time\u0027s up.\n*   **Section 15 (Deeper Vision):** Understanding stuff isn\u0027t just seeing with eyes. It\u0027s a different kind of perception (knowing the *meaning* of things like theft, sowing, buying, etc.).\n*   **Section 16 (The Good Man\u0027s Mark):** Basic functions (perception, impulse) are shared with animals and bad people (Nero). Having a mind guide actions? Even atheists or traitors do that. The *unique* mark of a truly good person?

      "text": "Alright, let\u0027s hit Book 3, coming at you from Carnuntum (sounds like a military outpost, probably cold).\n\n---\n\n**Meditations: Book 3 - The Bro Version**\n\n*(Scribbled down in Carnuntum, wherever the hell that is. Probably deployed.)*\n\n1.  **Your Brain Might Go First - Hurry Up!**\n    Okay, listen up. It\u0027s not just that life is burning down day by day, leaving less in the tank. You also gotta consider this: even if you *do* live longer, there\u0027s no guarantee your mind will stay sharp enough to actually *understand* shit – the deep stuff about life, the universe, everything. Your body might keep chugging along (breathing, eating, feeling basic urges), but the stuff that *matters* – using yourself correctly, making precise judgments about duty, analyzing what your senses are *really* telling you, knowing if it\u0027s time to gracefully exit, all that complex decision-making – that stuff starts fading *before* the body quits. So, get moving! Not just \u0027cause death is closer, but because your ability to process life and adapt properly might already be on the decline.\n\n2.  **Find the Cool in the Cracks**\n    Pay attention to the details, man. Even the side effects of natural processes have their own kind of rugged beauty. Like when bread bakes and cracks open? Those cracks technically mess up the baker\u0027s perfect plan, but they *look* cool, make you want to eat it more. Figs splitting open when ripe, olives getting that slightly \u0027overripe\u0027 look that\u0027s actually perfect. Corn stalks bending low, a lion\u0027s furrowed brow, foam on a boar\u0027s mouth – lots of stuff isn\u0027t \u0027pretty\u0027 up close, but because it\u0027s part of how Nature works, it adds character, a certain badass appeal. If you really *feel* and *understand* how the Universe operates, almost everything, even the small background details, will seem kinda awesome in its own way. You\u0027ll dig the real jaws of a wild animal as much as some artist\u0027s statue. You\u0027ll see a kind of vibrancy even in old age. You\u0027ll look at the people who work for you with clear, objective eyes. Lots of moments like this happen, not for everyone, but for the guy who\u0027s genuinely gotten in tune with Nature and its works.\n\n3.  **Everyone Punches Out**\n    Hippocrates cured tons of people, then got sick and died himself. Astrologers predicted futures, then their own clocks ran out. Alexander, Pompey, Caesar – leveled cities, killed countless soldiers – they eventually bit the dust too. Heraclitus talked fire and brimstone cosmology, then bloated up with fluid, covered himself in cow shit (weird!), and died. Lice got Democritus; different kind of parasite (bad people) got Socrates. The point? You got on the boat (born), you sailed (lived), you reached the port (dying). Time to disembark. If there\u0027s another life? Cool, gods are everywhere, even there. If it\u0027s just lights out (unconsciousness)? Then you stop feeling pain and pleasure, stop being a slave to this meat-sack vessel which is way inferior to the thing *using* it (your mind, your inner divinity). One is Mind and God-spark, the other is just clay and blood.\n\n4.  **Mind Your OWN Business (Seriously)**\n    Stop wasting the rest of your life obsessing about other people, *unless* it directly contributes to the common good. Why rob yourself of time you could use for your *own* growth? All that energy spent wondering \"What\u0027s he doing? Why\u0027d she say that? What are they thinking/planning?\" – it just pulls you away from keeping watch over your *own* governing self (your Reason). Cut out the random, pointless thoughts. Especially ditch the nosiness and negativity. Train yourself so if someone suddenly asked, \"Whatcha thinkin\u0027 about right now?\" you could answer instantly and honestly, \"Just this simple, kind thought,\" revealing you\u0027re a decent, social being, not hung up on selfish pleasures, petty rivalries, envy, suspicion, or anything else you\u0027d be embarrassed to admit was rattling around in your head. A guy like that, who stops delaying and steps up to be truly excellent? He\u0027s like a priest, serving the gods, using that inner core correctly. He keeps himself untainted by chasing pleasure, untouched by pain, unharmed by wrongs, unaware of petty wickedness. He\u0027s a wrestler in the ultimate match – refusing to be thrown by passion. Soaked in justice, welcoming *everything* that happens and is assigned to him. Rarely thinks about others\u0027 business, and only when absolutely necessary for the collective good. He\u0027s focused on *his* work, *his* contribution, constantly mindful of his assigned role in the Whole. He perfects his part, trusts his lot is good. Because that inner spirit (daemon) assigned to you? It guides you, carries you. Plus, remember all rational beings are related. Caring for all humans fits our nature. But cling to the opinions only of those living *in accord with Nature*. As for the others? Keep in mind what they\u0027re *really* like – at home, out and about, day and night, the crap company they keep. Don\u0027t waste energy on praise from people who don\u0027t even like *themselves*.\n\n5.  **Stand Up Straight (Metaphorically)**\n    Don\u0027t act grudgingly. Don\u0027t act selfishly. Don\u0027t act without thinking it through. Don\u0027t have conflicting motives. Don\u0027t let fancy words or appearances cover up sloppy thinking. Don\u0027t be a motormouth or a busybody meddler. Let the God *within you* be the guardian of a *real man* – mature, civic-minded, Roman, a leader who\u0027s taken his post like a soldier waiting for the signal to withdraw, ready to go, needing no external validation or witness. Have a cheerful face. Don\u0027t *need* help from outside or rely on others for your peace. You should stand upright *on your own*, not be propped up by others.\n\n6.  **Find the Best? Grab It. (Spoiler: It\u0027s Inside)**\n    If you find anything in life better than justice, truth, self-control, courage – better, basically, than your own Reason being satisfied with itself when it guides you to act rightly and accept fate calmly – if you see something *higher* than that? Turn to it with everything you\u0027ve got and enjoy that supreme good. BUT, if nothing shows up that\u0027s better than that divine spark *already seated within you*, the one that keeps your impulses in check, examines your thoughts, detaches from knee-jerk reactions (like Socrates said), aligns itself with the gods, and prioritizes caring for others... if you find everything else is smaller and cheaper than *this*? Then give no room to anything else. Because once you lean towards those other things (popularity, power, wealth, pleasure), you lose the ability to consistently honor what is uniquely *yours*, your own true good. It\u0027s just wrong to set up rivals (like fame or fortune) against the good of Reason and the Community. Those other things might seem okay for a bit, but they quickly take over and drag you off course. So, I\u0027m telling you: simply, freely, choose the higher path and *stick to it*. \"But higher means advantageous!\" Yeah, if it\u0027s advantageous to your *rational* self, lock onto it. If it only benefits your animal side, fine, admit it, but stick to your decision without making a big show. Just be damn sure you make a choice that won\u0027t screw you over later.\n\n7.  **Integrity Over Everything**\n    Never, ever value something as \u0027advantageous\u0027 if it forces you to break your word, lose self-respect, hate someone, be suspicious, curse others, fake it, or desire things that need secrets and cover-ups. The man who prioritizes his own Mind and inner Divinity, and the sacred practice of its excellence? He doesn\u0027t make a scene. He doesn\u0027t whine. He doesn\u0027t *need* to hide away in solitude *or* be constantly surrounded by crowds. Most importantly, he lives without desperately chasing things *or* desperately avoiding them. He doesn\u0027t give a damn whether he gets a longer or shorter time using this soul-in-a-body setup. Even if he has to check out *right now*, he\u0027ll go as smoothly and decently as he\u0027d do any other task, focused his whole life on just one thing: keeping his understanding aligned with what it means to be a rational, social being.\n\n8.  **Clean Inside, No Need to Hide**\n    Look inside the mind of a disciplined and purified person. You won\u0027t find any festering wounds, no rot, no hidden infections under the surface. Fate doesn\u0027t catch his life unfinished, like an actor leaving the stage mid-play. There\u0027s nothing slave-like or fake about him. He\u0027s not dependent on others, nor cut off from them. Nothing to make excuses for, nothing that needs a dark corner to hide in.\n\n9.  **Respect Your Judgment**\n    Revere your power of judgment. Everything depends on it – keeping your governing self aligned with Nature and the needs of a rational being. Good judgment promises deliberation, genuine connection with others, and walking in step with the gods/Universe.\n\n10. **Life\u0027s Tiny, Fame\u0027s Tinier**\n    So, throw everything else away and hold onto just these few core ideas. And remember: you only live *right now*, this tiny moment. The rest is either already lived or totally uncertain. Tiny life, tiny corner of the earth you live on, even the longest-lasting fame is tiny and depends on a chain of flawed mortals who\u0027ll be dead soon anyway and don\u0027t even know themselves, let alone some dude who died ages ago.\n\n11. **Break It Down: Analyze Everything**\n    Add this tool to your kit: Always make a mental sketch or outline of whatever impression hits you. See its core essence, naked, whole and in parts. Name it specifically, name its components, name what it will eventually break down into. Nothing builds mental greatness like the power to systematically and truthfully test *everything* you encounter. Always look at it thinking: What purpose does this serve in *this* kind of Universe? What\u0027s its value to the Whole? What\u0027s its value to *me*, a citizen of the highest City (the Cosmos), where all other cities are just households? What *is* this thing making an impression on me right now? What\u0027s it made of? How long will it naturally last? What virtue do I need to deal with it (kindness, courage, honesty, simplicity, self-reliance, etc.)? Therefore, for everything, say: \"This came from God/Fate.\" Or: \"This came from the interconnectedness of events, the cosmic web, coincidence.\" Or: \"This came from my fellow human, my kin, my comrade, who just doesn\u0027t know what\u0027s truly natural for him.\" But *I* do know. So I treat him kindly and justly, according to the natural law of fellowship. While still aiming for what\u0027s truly deserved, especially in matters that are morally neutral.\n\n12. **The Simple Path to a Good Life**\n    If you tackle the task at hand right now, following Reason – seriously, powerfully, kindly – and don\u0027t get sidetracked, but keep your inner divinity pure and strong, like you might have to give it back this very second... If you lock this down, expecting nothing, avoiding nothing, just content with *present action* aligned with Nature and heroic truth in what you say and mean... you *will* live a blessed life. And nobody can stop you from doing this.\n\n13. **Keep Your Principles Ready**\n    Just like doctors always have their tools ready for emergencies, you need your core principles (doctrines) always ready. Use them to understand the divine and human connection, and then do *everything*, even the smallest stuff, remembering that link. You won\u0027t do human stuff well without relating it to the divine perspective, and vice versa.\n\n14. **Stop Preparing, Start Living**\n    Quit wandering off track! You\u0027re not gonna get around to rereading all those notebooks, those histories of Rome and Greece, those quotes you saved up for \u0027old age\u0027. Get to the damn goal! Drop the wishful thinking. Help *yourself*, right now, if you care about yourself at all, while you still can.\n\n15. **Seeing Beyond the Surface**\n    Some people don\u0027t grasp the real meaning behind things like \u0027theft\u0027, \u0027sowing\u0027, \u0027buying\u0027, \u0027resting\u0027, \u0027seeing what needs doing\u0027. True understanding isn\u0027t just about physical eyesight; it requires a different kind of vision – insight into the principles.\n\n16. **The Mark of the Truly Good Man**\n    Body, Spirit, Mind. Body \u003d senses. Spirit \u003d impulses. Mind \u003d principles. Reacting to images? Animals do that. Being jerked around by impulses? Wild beasts and messed-up humans (like Phalaris or Nero) do that. Having your mind guide you towards apparent duties? Even atheists, traitors, and creeps who do bad stuff behind closed doors do that. So, if all that stuff is common ground... what\u0027s left as the *unique* mark of the genuinely good man? This: To love and welcome whatever happens, whatever fate spins for him. To *not* pollute the divinity within his chest or disturb it with a chaotic mob of thoughts. But to preserve it, keep it serene, follow God/Reason in an orderly way, never saying anything untrue, never doing anything unjust. And if *everyone* disbelieves he lives simply, modestly, cheerfully? He doesn\u0027t get angry, doesn\u0027t get knocked off the path leading to life\u0027s true goal – which he must reach pure, peaceful, ready to depart, effortlessly in sync with his own inner spirit.\n\n---\n\nBook 3 done.

      "text": "BOOK IV\n\n\n1. The sovereign power within, in its natural state, so confronts what comes to pass as always to adapt itself readily to what is feasible and is presented to it. This is because it puts its affection upon no material of its own choice; rather it sets itself upon its objects with a reservation, and then makes the opposition which encounters it into material for itself. It is like a fire, when it masters what falls into it, whereby a little taper would have been put out, but a bright fire very quickly appropriates and devours what is heaped upon it, and leaps up higher out of those very obstacles.\n\n2. Nothing that is undertaken is to be undertaken without a purpose, nor otherwise than according to a principle which makes the art of living perfect.\n\n3. Men look for retreats for themselves, the country, the sea-shore, the hills; and you yourself, too, are peculiarly accustomed to feel the same want. Yet all this is very unlike a philosopher, when you may at any hour you please retreat into yourself. For nowhere does a man retreat into more quiet or more privacy than into his own mind, especially one who has within such things that he has only to look into, and become at once in perfect ease; and by ease I mean nothing else but good behaviour. Continually, therefore, grant yourself this retreat and repair yourself. But let them be brief and fundamental truths, which will suffice at once by their presence to wash away all sorrow, and to send you back without repugnance to the life to which you return.\n\nFor what is it that shall move your repugnance? The wickedness of men? Recall the judgement that reasonable creatures have come into the world for the sake of one another; that patience is a part of justice; that men do wrong involuntarily; and how many at last, after enmity, suspicion, hatred, warfare, have been laid out on their death-beds and come to dust. This should make you pause. But shall what is assigned from Universal Nature be repugnant to you? Revive the alternative: \u0027either Providence or blind atoms\u0027, and the many proofs that the Universe is a kind of Commonwealth. Shall then the things of the flesh still have hold upon you? Reflect that the understanding, when once it takes control of itself and recognizes its own power, does not mingle with the vital spirit, be its current smooth or broken, and finally reflect upon all that you have heard and consented to about pain and pleasure.\n\nWell, then, shall mere glory distract you? Look at the swiftness of the oblivion of all men; the gulf of endless time, behind and before; the hollowness of applause, the fickleness and folly of those who seem to speak well of you, and the narrow room in which it is confined. This should make you pause. For the entire earth is a point in space, and how small a corner thereof is this your dwelling place, and how few and how paltry those who will sing your praises here!\n\nFinally, therefore, remember your retreat into this little domain which is yourself, and above all be not disturbed nor on the rack, but be free and look at things as a man, a human being, a citizen, a creature that must die. And among what is most ready to hand into which you will look have these two: the one, that things do not take hold upon the mind, but stand without unmoved, and that disturbances come only from the judgement within; the second, that all that your eyes behold will change in a moment and be no more; and of how many things you have already witnessed the changes, think continually of that.\n\nThe Universe is change, life is opinion.\n\n4. If mind is common to us all, then also the reason, whereby we are reasoning beings, is common. If this be so, then also the reason which enjoins what is to be done or left undone is common. If this be so, law also is common; if this be so, we are citizens; if this be so, we are partakers in one constitution; if this be so, the Universe is a kind of Commonwealth. For in what other common government can we say that the whole race of men partakes? And thence, from this common City, is derived our mind itself, our reason and our sense of law, or from what else? For as the earthy is in me a portion from some earth, and the watery from a second element, and the vital spirit from some source, and the hot and fiery from yet another source of its own (for nothing comes from nothing, just as nothing returns to nothing), so therefore the mind also has come from some source.\n\n5. Death is like birth, a mystery of Nature; a coming together out of identical elements and a dissolution into the same. Looked at generally this is not a thing of which man should be ashamed, for it is contrary neither to what is conformable to a reasonable creature nor to the principle of his constitution.\n\n6. These are natural and necessary results from creatures of this kind, and one who wants this to be otherwise wants the fig-tree not to yield its acrid juice. And in general remember this, that within a very little while both he and you will be dead, and a little after not even your name nor his will be left.\n\n7. Get rid of the judgement; you are rid of the \u0027I am hurt\u0027; get rid of the \u0027I am hurt\u0027, you are rid of the hurt itself.\n\n8. What does not make a man worse than he was, neither makes his life worse than it was, nor hurts him without or within.\n\n9. It was a law of necessity that what is naturally beneficial should bring this about.\n\n10. \u0027All that comes to pass comes to pass with justice.\u0027 You will find this to be so if you watch carefully. I do not mean only in accordance with the ordered series of events, but in accordance with justice and as it were by some one who assigns what has respect to worth. Watch, therefore, as you have begun and whatever you do, do it with this, with goodness in the specific sense in which the notion of the good man is conceived. Preserve this goodness in everything you do.\n\n11. Don\u0027t regard things in the light in which he who does the wrong judges them, nor as he wishes you to judge them: but see them as in truth they are.\n\n12. In these two ways you must always be prepared: the one, only to act as the principle of the royal and law-giving art prescribes for the benefit of mankind; the second, to change your purpose, if some one is there to correct and to guide you away from some fancy of yours. The guidance must, however, always be from a conviction of justice or common benefit ensuing, and what you prefer must be similar, not because it looked pleasant or popular.\n\n13. \u0027You have reason?\u0027 \u0027Yes, I have!\u0027 \u0027Why not use it then? If this is doing its part, what else do you want?\u0027\n\n14. You came into the world as a part. You will vanish in that which gave you birth, or rather you will be taken up into its generative reason by the process of change.\n\n15. Many grains of incense upon the same altar; one falls first, another later, but difference there is none.\n\n16. Within ten days you will appear a god even to those to whom to-day you seem a beast or a baboon, if you return to your principles and your reverence of the Word.\n\n17. Don\u0027t live as though you were going to live a myriad years. Fate is hanging over your head; while you have life, while you may, become good.\n\n18. How great a rest from labour he gains who does not look to what his neighbour says or does or thinks, but only to what he himself is doing, in order that exactly this may be just and holy, or in accord with a good man\u0027s conduct.[1] \u0027Do not look round at a black character,\u0027 but run toward the goal, balanced, not throwing your body about.\n\n19. The man in a flutter for after-fame fails to picture to himself that each of those who remember him will himself also very shortly die, then again the man who succeeded him, until the whole remembrance is extinguished as it runs along a line of men who are kindled and then put out. And put the case that those who will remember never die, and the remembrance never dies, what is that to you? And I do not say that it is nothing to the dead; what is praise to the living, except perhaps for some practical purpose? For now you are putting off unseasonably the gift of Nature, which does not depend on the testimony of some one else . . .[2]\n\n20. Everything in any way lovely is lovely of itself and terminates in itself, holding praise to be no part of itself. At all events, in no case does what is praised become better or worse. This I say also of what is commonly called lovely, for instance materials and works of art; and indeed what is there lacking at all to that which is really lovely? No more than to law, no more than to truth, no more than to kindness or reverence of self. Which of these is lovely because it is praised or corrupted because it is blamed? Does an emerald become worse than it was, if it be not praised? And what of gold, ivory, purple, a lute, a sword-blade, a flower-bud, a little plant?\n\n21. You ask how, if souls continue to exist, the atmosphere has room for them from time eternal. But how does the ground have room for the bodies of those who for so long an age are buried in it? The answer is that, as on earth change and dissolution after a continuance for so long make room for other dead bodies, so in the atmosphere souls pass on and continue for so long, and then change and are poured out and are kindled being assumed into the generative principle of Universal Nature, and so provide room for those which succeed to their place. This would be the answer presuming that souls do continue. But we must consider not only the multitude of bodies that are thus buried, but also the number of animals eaten every day by ourselves and the rest of the animal creation. How large a number are devoured and in a manner of speaking buried in the bodies of those who feed upon them; and yet there is room to contain them because they are turned into blood, because they are changed into forms of air and heat. How shall we investigate the truth of this? By a distinction into the material and the causal.\n\n22. Do not wander without a purpose, but in all your impulses render what is just, and in all your imaginations preserve what you apprehend.\n\n23. Everything is fitting for me, my Universe, which fits thy purpose. Nothing in thy good time is too early or too late for me; everything is fruit for me which thy seasons, Nature, bear; from thee, in thee, to thee are all things. The poet sings: \u0027Dear city of Cecrops\u0027, and will you not say: \u0027Dear city of God\u0027?\n\n24. Democritus has said: \u0027Do few things, if you would enjoy tranquillity.\u0027 May it not be better to do the necessary things and what the reason of a creature intended by Nature to be social prescribes, and as that reason prescribes? For this brings not only the tranquillity from doing right but also from doing few things. For if one removes most of what we say and do as unnecessary, he will have more leisure and less interruption. Wherefore on each occasion he should remind himself: \u0027Is this not one of the necessary things?\u0027 And he should remove not actions merely that are unnecessary, but imaginations also, for in this way superfluous actions too will not follow in their train.\n\n25. Make trial for yourself how the life of the good man, too, fares well, of the man pleased with what is assigned from Universal Nature and contented by his own just action and kind disposition.\n\n26. You have seen those things, look now at these: do not trouble yourself, make yourself simple. Does a man do wrong? He does wrong to himself. Has some chance befallen you? It is well; from Universal Nature, from the beginning, all that befalls was determined for you and the thread was spun. The sum of the matter is this: life is short; the present must be turned to profit with reasonableness and right. Be sober without effort.\n\n27. Either an ordered Universe or a medley heaped together mechanically but still an order; or can order subsist in you and disorder in the Whole! And that, too, when all things are so distinguished and yet intermingled and sympathetic.\n\n28. A black heart is an unmanly heart, a stubborn heart; resembling a beast of prey, a mere brute, or a child; foolish, crafty, ribald, mercenary, despotic.\n\n29. If he is a foreigner in the Universe who does not recognize the essence of the Universe, no less is he a foreigner, who does not recognize what comes to pass in it. A fugitive is he who runs away from the reasonable law of his City; a blind man, he who shuts the eye of the mind; a beggar, he who has need of another and has not all that is necessary for life in himself; a blain on the Universe, he who rebels and separates himself from the reason of our common nature because he is displeased with what comes to pass (for Nature who bore you, brings these things also into being); a fragment cut off from the City, he who cuts off his own soul from the soul of reasonable creatures, which is one.\n\n30. Here is a philosopher without a tunic, another without a book, another here half-naked. \u0027I have no bread,\u0027 he says, \u0027still I stand firm by the Word.\u0027 And I have nourishment from my lessons and yet do not stand firm.\n\n31. Love the art which you were taught, set up your rest in this. Pass through what is left of life as one who has committed all that is yours, with your whole heart, to the gods, and of men making yourself neither despot nor servant to any.\n\n32. Call to mind by way of example the time of Vespasian: you will see everything the same: men marrying, bringing up children, falling ill, dying, fighting, feasting, trading, farming, flattering, asserting themselves, suspecting, plotting, praying for another\u0027s death, murmuring at the present, lusting, heaping up riches, setting their heart on offices and thrones. And now that life of theirs is no more and nowhere.\n\nAgain pass on to the time of Trajan; again everything the same. That life, too, is dead. In like manner contemplate and behold the rest of the records of times and whole nations; and see how many after their struggles fell in a little while and were resolved into the elements. But most of all you must run over in mind those whom you yourself have known to be distracted in vain, neglecting to perform what was agreeable to their own constitution, to hold fast to this and to be content with this. And here you are bound to remember that the attention paid to each action has its own worth and proportion, only so you will not be dejected if in smaller matters you are occupied no farther than was appropriate.\n\n33. Words familiar in olden times are now archaisms; so also the names of those whose praises were hymned in bygone days are now in a sense archaisms; Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Dentatus; a little after, Scipio too and Cato; then also Augustus, then also Hadrian and Antoninus. For all things quickly fade and turn to fable, and quickly, too, utter oblivion covers them like sand. And this I say of those who shone like stars to wonder at; the rest, as soon as the breath was out of their bodies were \u0027unnoticed and unwept\u0027. And what after all is everlasting remembrance? Utter vanity. What then is that about which a man ought to spend his pains? This one thing: right understanding, neighbourly behaviour, speech which would never lie, and a disposition welcoming all which comes to pass, as necessary, as familiar, as flowing from a source and fountain like itself.\n\n34. With your whole will surrender yourself to Clotho to spin your fate into whatever web of things she will.\n\n35. All is ephemeral, both what remembers and what is remembered.\n\n36. Contemplate continually all things coming to pass by change, and accustom yourself to think that Universal Nature loves nothing so much as to change what is and to create new things in their likeness. For everything that is, is in a way the seed of what will come out of it, whereas you imagine seeds to be only those which are cast into the earth or into the womb. But that is very unscientific.\n\n37. You will presently be dead and are not yet simple, untroubled, void of suspicion that anything from outside can hurt you, not yet propitious to all men, nor counting wisdom to consist only in just action.\n\n38. Look into their governing principles, even the wise among them, what petty things they avoid and what pursue!\n\n39. Your evil does not consist in another\u0027s governing principle, nor indeed in any change and alteration of your environment. Where then? Where the part of you which judges about evil is. Let it not frame the judgement, and all is well. Even if what is nearest to it, your body, is cut, cauterized, suppurates, mortifies, still let the part which judges about these things be at rest; that is, let it decide that nothing is good or evil which can happen indifferently to the evil man and the good. For wnat happens indifferently to one whose life is contrary to Nature and to one whose life is according to Nature, this is neither according to nor contrary to Nature.\n\n40. Constantly think of the Universe as one living creature, embracing one being and one soul; how all is absorbed into the one consciousness of this living creature; how it compasses all things with a single purpose, and how all things work together to cause all that comes to pass, and their wonderful web and texture.\n\n41. You are a spirit bearing the weight of a dead body, as Epictetus used to say.\n\n42. For what comes to pass in the course of change nothing is evil, as nothing is good for what exists in consequence of change.\n\n43. There is a kind of river of things passing into being, and Time is a violent torrent. For no sooner is each seen, than it has been carried away, and another is being carried by, and that, too, will be carried away.\n\n44. All that comes to pass is as familiar and well known as the rose in spring and the grape in summer. Of like fashion are sickness, death, calumny, intrigue, and all that gladdens or saddens the foolish.\n\n45. What follows is always organically related to what went before; for it is not like a simple enumeration of units separately determined by necessity, but a rational combination; and as Being is arranged in a mutual coordination, so the phenomena of Becoming display no bare succession but a wonderful organic interrelation.\n\n46. Always remember what Heraclitus said: \u0027the death of earth is the birth of water, the death of water is the birth of atmosphere, the death of atmosphere is fire, and conversely\u0027. Remember, too, his image of the man who forgets the way he is going; and: \u0027they are at variance with that with which they most continuously have converse (Reason which governs the Universe), and the things they meet with every day appear alien to them\u0027; and again: \u0027we must not act and speak like men who sleep, for in sleep we suppose that we act and speak\u0027; and \u0027we must not be like children with parents\u0027, that is, accept things simply as we have received them.\n\n47. Just as, if one of the gods told you: \u0027to-morrow you will be dead or in any case the day after to-morrow\u0027, you would no longer be making that day after important any more than to-morrow, unless you are an arrant coward (for the difference is a mere trifle), in the same way count it no great matter to live to a year that is an infinite distance off rather than till to-morrow.\n\n48. Think continually how many physicians have died, after often knitting their foreheads over their patients; how many astrologers after prophesying other men\u0027s deaths, as though to die were a great matter; how many philosophers after endless debate on death or survival after death; how many paladins after slaying their thousands; how many tyrants after using their power over men\u0027s lives with monstrous arrogance, as if themselves immortal; how many entire cities have, if I may use the term, died, Helice, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and others innumerable. Run over, too, the many also you know of, one after another. One followed this man\u0027s funeral and then was himself laid on the bier; another followed him, and all in a little while. This is the whole matter: see always how ephemeral and cheap are the things of man—yesterday, a spot of albumen, to-morrow, ashes or a mummy. Therefore make your passage through this span of time in obedience to Nature and gladly lay down your life, as an olive, when ripe, might fall, blessing her who bare it and grateful to the tree which gave it life.\n\n49. Be like the headland on which the waves continually break, but it stands firm and about it the boiling waters sink to sleep. \u0027Unlucky am I, because this has befallen me.\u0027 Nay rather: \u0027Lucky am I, because, though this befell me, I continue free from sorrow, neither crushed by the present, nor fearing what is to come.\u0027 For such an event might have befallen any man, but not every man would have continued in it free from sorrow. On what grounds then is this ill fortune more than that good fortune? Do you, speaking generally, call what is not a deviation from man\u0027s nature a man\u0027s ill fortune, and do you suppose that what is not opposed to his natural will is a deviation from his nature? Very well, you have been taught what that will is. Can what has befallen you prevent your being just, high-minded, temperate, prudent, free from rash judgements, trustful, self-reverent, free, and whatever else by its presence with him enables a man\u0027s nature to secure what is really his? Finally, in every event which leads you to sorrow, remember to use this principle: that this is not a misfortune, but that to bear it like a brave man is good fortune.\n\n50. An unscientific but none the less a helpful support to disdain of death is to review those who have clung tenaciously to life. What more did they gain than those who died prematurely? In every case they are laid in some grave at last: Caedicianus, Fabius, Julianus, Lepidus, and any others like them, who after carrying many to the grave were themselves carried out. To speak generally the difference is a small one, and this difference long-drawn-out through what great toils and with what sorts of men and in how weak a body Do not count it then as a thing . . .; for see the gulf of time behind and another infinite time in front: in this what difference is there between a three-days-old infant and a Nestor of three generations?\n\n51. Run always the short road, and Nature\u0027s road is short. Therefore say and do everything in the soundest way, because a purpose like this delivers a man from troubles and warfare, from every care and superfluity.",

      "text": "The user wants a \"bro version\" translation of Marcus Aurelius\u0027s *Meditations*, Book 4. I need to maintain the style established in the previous translations:\n- Informal, modern language.\n- Focus on actionable advice and core concepts.\n- Direct address (\"you,\" \"dude,\" \"man\").\n- Use of modern analogies or slightly irreverent phrasing where appropriate, but without losing the serious Stoic message.\n- Keep the structure roughly aligned with the numbered paragraphs.\n\nLet\u0027s break down each paragraph of Book 4 and translate it into the target style.\n\n1.  **Original:** The sovereign power within adapts readily to what\u0027s feasible. Doesn\u0027t cling to specific material. Uses obstacles as fuel, like fire consuming what\u0027s thrown into it.\n    **Bro Version:** Your inner Boss (Reason) is naturally adaptable. It rolls with the punches, takes what\u0027s possible, and doesn\u0027t get hung up on wanting specific outcomes. It doesn\u0027t *need* perfect conditions. Instead, it uses challenges as fuel. Like a badass bonfire: a small flame gets snuffed, but a roaring fire eats up whatever you throw on it and burns even higher *because* of the obstacles.\n2.  **Original:** Everything needs a purpose, aligned with the art of living.\n    **Bro Version:** Don\u0027t do shit without a point. Everything should line up with the master principle of living well. No random actions.\n3.  **Original:** People seek external retreats (country, beach). You want this too. But the best retreat is internal, into your own mind. Go there for peace and ease (good behavior). Use brief, fundamental truths to reset. Reasons for annoyance: Men\u0027s wickedness? Remember we\u0027re social, patience is just, wrongdoing is involuntary, everyone dies. Assigned lot? Remember Providence vs. Atoms, Universe as Commonwealth. Body issues? Mind is separate, recall lessons on pain/pleasure. Glory? Remember oblivion, tiny space, fickle praise. Retreat into yourself. Things don\u0027t touch the mind, only judgment does. Everything changes. Universe is change, life is opinion.\n    **Bro Version:** Guys look for escapes – cabins, beaches, mountains. You feel that pull too. But that\u0027s rookie thinking. The ultimate retreat? Anytime you want, just go inside your own head. Nowhere quieter or more private. Especially if you\u0027ve got solid principles stored there. Just look inward, instant calm. And by calm, I mean *good inner order*. Hit this internal reset button often. Keep it brief: just grab those core truths. They\u0027ll wash away the stress and send you back ready to deal. What\u0027s bugging you? Shitty people? Remember: we\u0027re built for each other, being patient is part of justice, people mess up out of ignorance, and everyone ends up as dust anyway (enemies, rivals, everyone). Chill out. Your assigned situation bugging you? Refresh the basics: either there\u0027s a Plan (Providence) or just random atoms colliding. Remember the proof that the Universe is like one big community. Body aches still getting to you? Remember your Mind, once it takes charge, isn\u0027t tied to the body\u0027s ups and downs. Recall what you learned about handling pain and pleasure. Chasing fame distracting you? Think how fast everyone forgets everything. The endless abyss of time before and after you. How hollow applause is, how stupid and changeable the praisers are, how tiny the stage is. Seriously pause. The whole Earth is just a dot. Your home? A tiny corner of that dot. The people praising you there? Few and insignificant. So yeah, final reminder: retreat into *this* little space – yourself. Above all, don\u0027t get stressed or tortured. Be free. Look at things like a man, a human, a citizen, a mortal. Keep two things handy: 1) External shit can\u0027t *touch* your mind, it just stands there. Your inner *judgment* causes the disturbance. 2) Everything you see is changing constantly and will disappear. Think how much change you\u0027ve already seen! The Universe *is* change; your life *is* your perception of it.\n4.  **Original:** If mind/reason is common, so is the reason guiding actions, so is law, so we\u0027re citizens of one constitution, the Universe is a Commonwealth. Where else does our mind/reason/law come from? Like earth from earth, water from water, mind comes from a source.\n    **Bro Version:** If we all share Mind (Reason), then the core logic telling us what to do/not do is also shared. If that\u0027s true, then the fundamental Law is shared. If that\u0027s true, we\u0027re all citizens. If that\u0027s true, we\u0027re part of one big system (Constitution). If that\u0027s true, the Universe is basically one big Commonwealth. Where else would our own mind, reason, and sense of law come from? Just like the dirt part of you comes from Earth, the water part from water, the fire part from fire (nothing comes from nothing), your Mind has to come from some universal Source too.\n5.  **Original:** Death is like birth, a natural mystery, combining and dissolving elements. Nothing shameful, aligns with reason and our constitution.\n    **Bro Version:** Death is just like birth – a natural process, a mystery. Elements coming together, elements breaking apart into the same stuff. Big picture? Nothing to be ashamed of. It doesn\u0027t contradict being rational or the basic design of things.\n6.  **Original:** Bad things from bad people are natural consequences. Wanting figs without juice is dumb. Remember you and the offender will both be dead soon, names forgotten.\n    **Bro Version:** People acting like assholes? That\u0027s just the natural, necessary result of *being* that kind of asshole. Wishing they wouldn\u0027t is like wishing a fig tree didn\u0027t have its sharp juice. Get real. And remember: in a blink, both you and that dude will be dead. Soon after, nobody will even remember your names.\n7.  **Original:** Remove judgment \"I am hurt,\" remove the hurt itself.\n    **Bro Version:** Drop the judgment \"I\u0027ve been wronged.\" Poof, the feeling of being wronged disappears. Drop the feeling, drop the hurt itself.\n8.  **Original:** What doesn\u0027t make the man worse doesn\u0027t make his life worse, doesn\u0027t harm him internally or externally.\n    **Bro Version:** If it doesn\u0027t make *you* a worse person (less just, brave, temperate, wise), then it doesn\u0027t make your *life* worse. It doesn\u0027t actually harm you, inside or out.\n9.  **Original:** Necessary law: what\u0027s naturally beneficial happens.\n    **Bro Version:** It\u0027s a fundamental law: the naturally beneficial thing *had* to happen this way for the system to work.\n10. **Original:** \u0027All that happens, happens justly.\u0027 Watch carefully. Not just sequence, but according to worth/justice. Act with goodness in this specific sense. Preserve it.\n    **Bro Version:** \"Whatever happens, happens justly.\" Pay close attention, you\u0027ll see it\u0027s true. Not just \u0027in order,\u0027 but *fairly*, like someone assigning things based on true value or cosmic balance. So, keep watching like you started, and whatever you do, do it with *goodness* – the real-deal good-man kind. Keep that quality in everything.\n11. **Original:** Don\u0027t see things as the wrongdoer sees them or wants you to see them. See them truthfully.\n    **Bro Version:** Don\u0027t buy into the wrongdoer\u0027s twisted perspective or how *they* want you to see things. See the situation for what it *truly* is.\n12. **Original:** Be ready two ways: 1) Act only for the benefit of others according to reason/law. 2) Be ready to change course if corrected with reason towards justice/common good, not just what looks pleasant/popular.\n    **Bro Version:** Always be prepped for two things: 1) Only act based on what Reason (your inner king/lawgiver) dictates for the good of the human team. 2) Be willing to change your plan if someone corrects you or guides you away from a bad idea *with solid reasoning* based on justice or the common good. Don\u0027t change just because something *sounds* nice or is popular.\n13. **Original:** \u0027Got reason?\u0027 \u0027Yeah.\u0027 \u0027Then use it! What else do you need?\u0027\n    **Bro Version:** \"You got Reason?\" \"Yeah, I do!\" \"Well, why the hell aren\u0027t you using it? If your Reason is doing its job, what more could you possibly want?\"\n14. **Original:** You came as a part, you\u0027ll vanish into your source, taken up into its generative reason via change.\n    **Bro Version:** You showed up as a part of the Whole. You\u0027ll disappear back into what made you. More accurately, you\u0027ll get reabsorbed into the Universe\u0027s creative force through change. Cycle of life, man.\n15. **Original:** Incense grains on altar, some fall first, some later. No difference.\n    **Bro Version:** Think of incense grains tossed on the same altar fire. One burns up now, another a second later. Does it make any real difference which went first? Nope. Same with death.\n16. **Original:** In 10 days, you\u0027ll seem godlike even to those who see you as an animal now, if you return to principles and Reason.\n    **Bro Version:** Give it ten days. Stick to your principles, show reverence for Reason (the Word/Logos). Even the people who think you\u0027re a clown or an animal today might start looking at you like you\u0027re some kind of god. Consistency pays off.\n17. **Original:** Don\u0027t live like you have infinite time. Fate looms. Be good NOW while you can.\n    **Bro Version:** Stop living like you\u0027ve got ten thousand years. Fate is breathing down your neck. While you\u0027re alive, while you *can*, get good. Now.\n18. **Original:** Rest gained by ignoring neighbour\u0027s words/deeds/thoughts, focusing only on your own just/holy actions. Don\u0027t look at black characters, run straight to the goal.\n    **Bro Version:** Man, you get so much peace when you stop obsessing over what your neighbor says, does, or thinks, and focus ONLY on what *you* are doing. Make sure *your* actions are just, aligned with Nature, the actions of a good person. Don\u0027t get distracted by dark characters or bad examples. Run straight towards your goal, stay balanced, don\u0027t flail around.\n19. **Original:** Man chasing fame forgets rememberers also die soon, until memory extinguished. Even if rememberers immortal, what\u0027s that to you? Praise is nothing to dead, maybe useful for living practicality? Putting off Nature\u0027s gift (inner worth) for external testimony...\n    **Bro Version:** The guy desperate for fame forgets that everyone who remembers him will also die soon. Then the next generation dies, and so on, until the whole memory fizzles out like a faulty fuse. Even if, hypothetically, the rememberers *and* the memory lasted forever, what\u0027s that got to do with *you*? And I\u0027m not just saying it\u0027s useless to the *dead* – what good is praise to the *living*, except maybe for some practical angle (like getting a job)? Right now, you\u0027re stupidly ditching the real gift of Nature (your inner worth) which doesn\u0027t need someone else\u0027s validation...\n20. **Original:** Truly lovely things are lovely in themselves, praise isn\u0027t part of them. Praise doesn\u0027t make them better/worse (e.g., emerald, gold, art, flower). What does true loveliness lack? Nothing, like law, truth, kindness, self-respect. Are these better/worse by praise/blame?\n    **Bro Version:** Anything genuinely awesome is awesome *on its own*. It ends in itself. Praise isn\u0027t part of its package. Getting praised doesn\u0027t make it better, getting blamed doesn\u0027t make it worse. This goes for stuff people call beautiful too – materials, art. What does something *truly* beautiful lack? Nothing. Same as Law, Truth, Kindness, Self-Respect. Are any of *these* things better because they\u0027re praised, or ruined because they\u0027re blamed? Does an emerald suck if nobody compliments it? What about gold, ivory, purple dye, a musical instrument, a sword, a flower bud, a plant? Nope. Their quality is inherent.\n21. **Original:** How does air hold infinite souls? How does ground hold infinite bodies? Change/dissolution makes room on earth. Souls in air change/dissolve/rekindle into generative principle, making room. Presuming souls continue. Consider bodies buried AND animals eaten daily. Room made by transformation (blood, air, heat). Investigate via material/causal distinction.\n    **Bro Version:** Someone asks: \"If souls last forever, how does the air have enough room for all of them?\" Counter-question: \"How does the ground have room for all the bodies buried over millennia?\" Answer: Just like bodies decompose and make space on Earth, maybe souls in the air also transform, dissolve, get reabsorbed and \u0027reignited\u0027 into the Universe\u0027s creative energy (the generative principle), making room for new ones. *If* souls even continue, that is. But think about it: not just bodies buried, but how many animals do we (and other animals) eat *every single day*? Tons get consumed, basically buried in our bodies. Yet there\u0027s room, because they transform – into blood, air, heat. How to really figure this stuff out? Break it down: analyze the Material aspect and the Causal (the \u0027why\u0027 and \u0027how\u0027).\n22. **Original:** Don\u0027t wander purposelessly. Render justice in impulses, preserve apprehension in imaginations.\n    **Bro Version:** Don\u0027t just drift aimlessly. In every impulse to act, make sure it\u0027s *just*. In every thought or mental image, hold onto clear *understanding*.\n23. **Original:** Everything fitting for Universe fits me. Nothing too early/late. All is fruit from Nature\u0027s seasons. From Thee, in Thee, to Thee. Poet: \u0027Dear city of Cecrops\u0027. You: \u0027Dear city of God\u0027.\n    **Bro Version:** Whatever works for you, my Universe, works for me. Nothing you schedule is too early or too late for me. Everything your seasons bring, Nature, is fruit for me. All things come from You, exist in You, return to You. Some poet sings, \"Oh beloved Athens!\" Shouldn\u0027t you be saying, \"Oh beloved City of God (the Cosmos)!\"?\n24. **Original:** Democritus: \u0027Do few things for tranquility.\u0027 Better: do necessary things prescribed by social reason. Brings tranquility from right action AND few actions. Remove unnecessary words/deeds -\u003e more leisure/less interruption. Ask: \u0027Is this necessary?\u0027 Remove unnecessary actions AND imaginations to prevent superfluous actions.\n    **Bro Version:** Democritus said: \"Do less, be happier.\" Maybe better: Do what\u0027s *necessary*, what the reason of a naturally social creature tells you to do, *how* it tells you to do it. This brings peace not just from doing *right*, but also from doing *less*. Cut out most of the unnecessary crap we say and do, and you\u0027ll have more free time and fewer interruptions. So, constantly ask yourself: \"Is this *really* necessary?\" Cut unnecessary *actions*, but also cut unnecessary *thoughts* and *imaginations* – because those lead to pointless actions later.\n25. **Original:** Try living the good man\u0027s life: pleased with assigned lot, content with own just action and kind disposition.\n    **Bro Version:** Try it out for yourself: see how well the life of the good man goes – the guy who\u0027s cool with what the Universe assigns him and satisfied with his own just actions and kind attitude.\n26. **Original:** You\u0027ve seen those things, now look at these: don\u0027t trouble yourself, simplify. Man wrongs? Wrongs himself. Something bad happens? It\u0027s fine; part of the plan from the start. Sum: life short; use present reasonably/rightly. Be sober without struggle.\n    **Bro Version:** You\u0027ve seen all *that* external chaos. Now look at *this* internal stuff: Stop stressing. Simplify. Someone does wrong? They screw *themselves* over. Something happens *to* you? It\u0027s fine. It was all part of the cosmic plan, woven into your thread from the beginning. Bottom line: Life is short. Use the present moment wisely and justly. Be grounded, stay sober (mentally clear) without a big struggle.\n27. **Original:** Either ordered Universe or random heap that\u0027s still ordered. Can order be in you and disorder in the Whole? Especially when things are distinct yet connected/sympathetic.\n    **Bro Version:** Look, it\u0027s either an ordered Universe (a Cosmos) or just a random pile of crap thrown together – but even a pile has *some* kind of order. Can you possibly have order *inside you* while the entire Whole is just chaos? Especially when everything is so clearly distinct yet interconnected and interacting? Doesn\u0027t make sense.\n28. **Original:** Black heart \u003d unmanly, stubborn, beastly, brutish, childish, foolish, crafty, vulgar, mercenary, tyrannical.\n    **Bro Version:** A \"black heart\" (character) is weak, stubborn, like a predator, an animal, a child; it\u0027s foolish, sneaky, vulgar, greedy, tyrannical. It\u0027s just bad news.\n29. **Original:** Foreigner \u003d doesn\u0027t recognize Universe\u0027s essence OR what happens in it. Fugitive \u003d runs from City\u0027s law. Blind \u003d shuts mind\u0027s eye. Beggar \u003d needs others, isn\u0027t self-sufficient. Blain \u003d rebels against common nature/reason due to displeasure with events (Nature brings events). Fragment \u003d cuts own soul off from the one reasonable soul.\n    **Bro Version:** Who\u0027s a foreigner in the Universe? The guy who doesn\u0027t get its basic nature. Also the guy who doesn\u0027t get what *happens* in it. Who\u0027s a fugitive? The guy running from the reasonable law of our shared City (the Cosmos). Who\u0027s blind? The guy who shuts the eye of his mind. Who\u0027s a beggar? The guy who always needs something from others and isn\u0027t self-sufficient for life\u0027s essentials. Who\u0027s a tumor on the Universe? The guy who rebels and cuts himself off from our shared rational nature just because he doesn\u0027t like what\u0027s happening (dude, the same Nature that made *you* made *this* happen). Who\u0027s a broken piece? The guy who disconnects his own soul from the single soul of all rational beings.\n30. **Original:** Philosopher without tunic, another without book, another half-naked. \u0027No bread, but stand by the Word.\u0027 I have lessons but don\u0027t stand firm.\n    **Bro Version:** Look around: here\u0027s a philosopher with no shirt, another with no books, another half-naked. One says, \"I got no bread, but I stand by Reason (the Word).\" Meanwhile, *I* have access to all this learning and nourishment, and yet *I* struggle to stand firm. Check yourself.\n31. **Original:** Love your art/craft. Rest in it. Live rest of life committed to gods, making self neither despot nor servant to any man.\n    **Bro Version:** Love the craft you\u0027ve learned (your role, your principles). Make your stand there. Go through the rest of your life having fully entrusted everything that\u0027s yours to the gods, and relating to other people without being a tyrant *or* a slave to anyone.\n32. **Original:** Remember Vespasian\u0027s time: same stuff - marrying, kids, sickness, death, war, feasts, trade, farming, flattery, ambition, plotting, wishing death on others, complaining, lusting, hoarding wealth, chasing power. That life is gone. Same for Trajan\u0027s time. Dead too. Look at records of times/nations: many struggled, fell, dissolved. Think of those *you* knew distracted by vanity, neglecting their own constitution/role. Remember attention to each action has own worth/proportion. Don\u0027t get down if occupied with smaller things appropriately.\n    **Bro Version:** Think back, like, to Vespasian\u0027s era. You\u0027ll see the exact same shit: people getting married, raising kids, getting sick, dying, fighting wars, partying, trading, farming, sucking up, being arrogant, suspecting rivals, plotting, praying for others to die, bitching about the present, chasing sex, hoarding cash, gunning for promotions and power. Where is that life now? Gone. Nowhere. Okay, fast forward to Trajan\u0027s time. Same deal. That life? Also dead. Do this for other historical periods, entire nations. See how many people struggled hard, then poof, died and turned back into elements. Most importantly, think about the people *you personally knew* who got totally distracted by pointless stuff, neglecting to do what aligned with their own nature, failing to just stick to their role and be content. You gotta remember: paying proper attention to each action has its own value and appropriate scale. So don\u0027t get discouraged if you\u0027re focused on smaller tasks, as long as you\u0027re giving them the *right amount* of attention for what they are.\n33. **Original:** Old words are now archaic. Same for names of praised heroes (Camillus, Cato, Scipio, Augustus, Hadrian, Antoninus). All fades to fable, then oblivion. Even stars fade. Others \u0027unnoticed/unwept\u0027. Everlasting remembrance? Vanity. What deserves effort? Right understanding, neighborly behavior, truthful speech, welcoming disposition towards events (necessary, familiar, from the source).\n    **Bro Version:** Words that were common back then sound weird and old now. Same goes for the names of famous heroes people used to sing about – Camillus, Cato, Scipio, even Augustus, Hadrian, Antoninus – they\u0027re becoming historical artifacts. Everything fades fast, turns into legends, then gets totally buried by oblivion. And I\u0027m talking about the superstars! The rest? As soon as they stopped breathing, they were \"unnoticed and unwept.\" What even *is* \"everlasting remembrance\"? Total bullshit vanity. So what *should* you actually put your effort into? Just this: solid understanding, treating people decently, speaking truthfully, and having an attitude that welcomes *everything* that happens as necessary, familiar, flowing from the same source as you.\n34. **Original:** Surrender fully to Clotho (Fate) to spin your destiny.\n    **Bro Version:** Willingly hand yourself over to Fate (Clotho) and let her weave you into whatever pattern of events she wants.\n35. **Original:** All is ephemeral: rememberer and remembered.\n    **Bro Version:** Everything is temporary: the person remembering, and the thing being remembered. Gone in a flash.\n36. **Original:** Contemplate constant change. Nature loves changing things, creating new similar things. Everything is seed for what comes next. Seeds aren\u0027t just earth/womb ones. Unscientific view.\n    **Bro Version:** Constantly observe how everything comes about through change. Get used to the idea: Universal Nature loves nothing more than changing what exists and creating new things just like it. Everything that *is* right now is basically a seed for what *will be*. You think \u0027seeds\u0027 are just the things you plant in the ground or a womb? That\u0027s way too narrow-minded.\n37. **Original:** You\u0027ll be dead soon, yet not simple, untroubled, free of suspicion, propitious to all, counting wisdom as just action only.\n    **Bro Version:** You\u0027re gonna be dead any minute now, and you\u0027re *still* not: simple, calm, free from paranoia about external threats, genuinely well-disposed towards everyone, or understanding that wisdom is simply *acting justly*. Get it together.\n38. **Original:** Look at governing principles of even the wise: what petty things they avoid/pursue!\n    **Bro Version:** Check out the core motivations even of supposedly wise people. See what trivial shit they avoid and what pointless stuff they chase! It\u0027s revealing.\n39. **Original:** Your evil isn\u0027t in another\u0027s mind or environment change. It\u0027s in your judgment faculty. Stop judging it evil, all\u0027s well. Even if body cut/burned/rots, let judging part rest. Decide nothing is good/evil that happens equally to good/bad men. What happens equally to Nature-follower and Nature-opponent is neither according to nor contrary to Nature.\n    **Bro Version:** Your \u0027bad situation\u0027 isn\u0027t located in someone else\u0027s head, nor is it caused by changes in your surroundings. Where is it then? It\u0027s in the part of *you* that *judges* things as bad. Just stop making that judgment, and everything\u0027s fine. Even if your body (the closest thing to \u0027you\u0027) gets cut, burned, infected, or starts rotting – let the part that judges these things *stay calm*. Decide that nothing is truly \u0027good\u0027 or \u0027bad\u0027 if it can happen equally to a bad person and a good person. Because whatever happens indifferently to someone living against Nature and someone living *with* Nature, that thing itself must be neutral – neither aligned with nor against Nature.\n40. **Original:** Think of Universe as one living creature: one being, one soul. All absorbed into its one consciousness. All works for one purpose, together, wonderful web.\n    **Bro Version:** Constantly picture the entire Universe as one single living Thing, with one unified Being and one Soul. Think about how everything gets absorbed into this single consciousness; how it directs everything with a single purpose; how all things work together to create everything that happens – a complex, amazing interconnected web.\n41. **Original:** You are a spirit carrying a corpse (Epictetus).\n    **Bro Version:** You\u0027re basically a soul dragging around a dead weight (your body). Like Epictetus used to say.\n42. **Original:** Nothing is evil in the course of change, just as nothing is good for what exists due to change.\n    **Bro Version:** In the process of natural change, nothing is inherently \u0027evil\u0027, just as nothing that comes *from* change is inherently \u0027good\u0027. It just *is*.\n43. **Original:** River of becoming, Time is violent torrent. Things seen, then carried away, replaced by others to be carried away.\n    **Bro Version:** There\u0027s this constant river of things coming into existence, and Time is like a raging flood. As soon as you see something, it\u0027s swept away, and another thing rushes by, only to be swept away too. Constant flux.\n44. **Original:** All that happens is familiar, like roses in spring, grapes in summer. Sickness, death, slander, plots, things that excite/sadden fools - all normal patterns.\n    **Bro Version:** Everything that happens is as normal and expected as roses blooming in spring or grapes ripening in summer. Sickness, death, people talking shit, scheming, all the stuff that makes fools happy or sad – it\u0027s all part of the regular, predictable pattern.\n45. **Original:** What follows is always related to what went before. Not just numbered list, but rational combination. Being is coordinated, Becoming shows organic interrelation.\n    **Bro Version:** Whatever happens next is always logically connected to what came before. It\u0027s not just a random list of events forced together; it\u0027s a rational sequence, an organic combination. Just like the fundamental structure of Reality (Being) is coordinated, the way things unfold (Becoming) shows this amazing, interconnected relationship.\n46. **Original:** Remember Heraclitus: death of earth-\u003ewater, water-\u003eair, air-\u003efire, \u0026 vice versa. Man forgets way. Variance with Logos. Daily things seem alien. Don\u0027t act/speak like sleepwalkers. Don\u0027t be like kids with parents (accepting blindly).\n    **Bro Version:** Always remember what Heraclitus said: \"Earth dies to become water, water dies to become air, air dies to become fire, and back again.\" Remember his image of the guy who forgets where he\u0027s going. And how people are constantly \"at odds with the Reason (Logos) that governs everything,\" the very thing they interact with most. How stuff they see every day seems strange to them. Don\u0027t \"act and speak like people who are asleep\" (because we think we\u0027re acting/speaking in dreams too). And don\u0027t be \"like children with their parents,\" just blindly accepting things as they\u0027re told without thinking.\n47. **Original:** If god said \u0027dead tomorrow or day after\u0027, you wouldn\u0027t care about day after unless coward (diff trivial). Same way, living infinitely far vs tomorrow is no big deal.\n    **Bro Version:** Imagine a god told you, \"You\u0027re gonna die tomorrow, or definitely the day after.\" Unless you\u0027re a total coward, you wouldn\u0027t make a big deal about that extra day, right? The difference is tiny. Apply the same logic: living till some far-off year versus just living till tomorrow? It\u0027s not a huge difference in the grand scheme. Don\u0027t sweat the timeline.\n48. **Original:** Think how many doctors died after fussing over patients. Astrologers after predicting deaths. Philosophers after debating death. Warriors after killing thousands. Tyrants after abusing power. Whole cities died (Helice, Pompeii). Run over those you knew. One buries another, then gets buried. Short time. See ephemeral/cheap human things: yesterday slime, tomorrow ash/mummy. Pass through time obeying Nature, gladly die like ripe olive falling, blessing source.\n    **Bro Version:** Constantly think about this: How many doctors have died, after all their brow-furrowing over patients? How many astrologers, after predicting everyone else\u0027s death like it was some huge event? How many philosophers, after endless debates about death and afterlife? How many warriors, after killing thousands? How many tyrants, after throwing their weight around like they were immortal? How many *entire cities* have died (Pompeii, Herculaneum, countless others)? Run through the list of people *you* knew, one after another. One guy buries his friend, then gets buried himself. Then the next guy. It all happens fast. The whole point: always see how temporary and ultimately cheap human affairs are. Yesterday, a blob of goo; tomorrow, ashes or a mummy. So, travel through your little slice of time following Nature\u0027s way. Lay down your life gladly when it\u0027s time, like a ripe olive falling from the tree – blessing the Nature that produced it and grateful to the tree that gave it life.\n49. **Original:** Be like headland waves crash on; stands firm, waters calm around it. \u0027Unlucky me, this happened.\u0027 No: \u0027Lucky me, though this happened, I remain free from sorrow, uncrushed, unfearing.\u0027 Could happen to anyone, not everyone remains sorrow-free. Why is this misfortune more than that good fortune? Is what doesn\u0027t deviate from man\u0027s nature misfortune? Is what\u0027s not opposed to natural will a deviation? You know the will. Can this event stop you being just, magnanimous, temperate, prudent, careful, truthful, self-respecting, free, etc (man\u0027s nature securing his own)? In sorrowful events, use principle: this isn\u0027t misfortune, but bearing it bravely IS good fortune.\n    **Bro Version:** Be like a rocky cliff that waves constantly crash against. It stands firm, and the churning water settles down around it. Don\u0027t think, \"Poor me, this awful thing happened!\" Instead, think: \"Lucky me! Because even though this happened, I\u0027m still here, free from grief, not crushed by the present, not afraid of the future.\" Look, this kind of shit could happen to anyone. But not everyone could handle it without breaking down. So why call the event itself \u0027bad luck\u0027 rather than call your ability to handle it \u0027good luck\u0027? Do you seriously call something \u0027misfortune\u0027 if it doesn\u0027t violate fundamental human nature? Do you think something is unnatural if it doesn\u0027t contradict your natural will (aligned with Reason)? You *know* what that will is. Can this thing that happened *stop* you from being just, courageous, self-controlled, prudent, deliberate, trustworthy, dignified, free? Can it stop you from having any of the qualities that let a person\u0027s nature fulfill its potential? Bottom line: whenever something happens that makes you want to grieve, use this principle: The event itself isn\u0027t a misfortune. *Bearing it bravely* – THAT is good fortune.\n50. **Original:** Unscientific but helpful aid against fear of death: review those who clung hard to life. What more did they gain? All buried eventually (Caedicianus, Fabius, etc.). Difference small, achieved via great toils, weak body. Don\u0027t count it... See gulf of time behind/ahead. What diff between 3-day baby and ancient Nestor?\n    **Bro Version:** Here’s a slightly rough but helpful way to deal with fear of death: Think about all those people who desperately clung to life. What extra did they *really* get compared to those who died young? They all ended up in a hole eventually – think of Caedicianus, Fabius, Julianus, Lepidus, all those guys who buried others and then got buried themselves. The difference in lifespan is usually small, and that extra time is often filled with struggles, dealing with difficult people, and living in a decaying body. So don\u0027t overvalue it. Look at the infinite abyss of time behind you and the infinite abyss ahead. In that scale, what\u0027s the real difference between a baby who lives three days and some ancient dude like Nestor who lived three generations? Tiny.\n51. **Original:** Run the short road, Nature\u0027s road. Say/do everything soundly. Delivers from troubles, warfare, cares, superfluity.\n    **Bro Version:** Always take the shortcut – and Nature\u0027s road *is* the shortcut. So, say and do everything in the most rational, sound way possible. Sticking to this path frees you from hassles, conflicts, needless worries, and all kinds of unnecessary bullshit.",

      "text": "Okay, lining up Book 4 in the \"bro version\" style.\n\n---\n\n**Meditations: Book 4 - The Bro Version**\n\n1.  **Your Inner Boss is Adaptable Like Fire**\n    The command center inside you, your core Reason? In its natural state, it faces whatever happens by instantly adapting to what\u0027s actually possible and presented. It doesn\u0027t get obsessed with one specific outcome or material. Instead, it approaches goals with a crucial \u0027plan B\u0027 mentality (*with a reservation*). Then, whatever obstacle gets in the way? It turns *that* into fuel for itself. Think of fire: a tiny candle gets snuffed out by a pile of stuff, but a roaring blaze takes whatever you throw on it, consumes it, and leaps *even higher* because of those very obstacles. Your Reason can do that too.\n\n2.  **Act With Purpose, Live With Skill**\n    Don\u0027t launch into anything without a clear purpose. And don\u0027t do it any other way than according to the core principles that perfect the art of living. No random shit, only deliberate, skilled action.\n\n3.  **The Ultimate Retreat is Internal**\n    People hunt for quiet spots – cabins, beaches, mountains. You feel that same urge sometimes, wanting to get away. Totally normal. But it\u0027s kinda rookie-level thinking for a philosopher, because you can retreat *anytime you want* just by going inside your own head. Seriously, nowhere is quieter or more private than your own mind. Especially if you\u0027ve stocked it with solid principles. Just look inward, and bam – instant ease. And by \u0027ease,\u0027 I mean *good inner order*, being well-behaved internally. So, keep giving yourself this mental retreat. Make it a regular thing to repair and reset yourself. Keep it quick: focus on brief, fundamental truths. They\u0027ll be enough to wash away the stress and send you back to deal with life without resentment.\n\n    What\u0027s making you resentful? Other people\u0027s bullshit? Remember the core judgment: we rational creatures exist for each other. Patience is a part of justice. People screw up unintentionally (out of ignorance). And think how many people – after all the drama, suspicion, hatred, and fighting – ended up laid out dead and turned to dust. That should give you pause. Okay, maybe it\u0027s your assigned \u0027lot\u0027 in life that\u0027s bugging you? Refresh the basic options: either there\u0027s a guiding Plan (Providence) or it\u0027s all just random atoms colliding (and even then, patterns emerge). Remember all the evidence suggesting the Universe is like one big, interconnected community (Commonwealth). Still letting physical stuff get to you? Remind yourself that your understanding (mind), once it gets its act together and knows its own power, doesn\u0027t get tangled up in the body\u0027s ups and downs, whether things feel smooth or rough. And finally, recall everything you\u0027ve heard and agreed to about handling pain and pleasure rationally.\n\n    Alright, what about chasing fame and glory? Is *that* distracting you? Look at how fast *everyone* is forgotten. Think about the infinite abyss of time stretching behind you and before you. Consider how hollow applause is, how fickle and clueless most \u0027praisers\u0027 are, and how tiny the stage (your circle, your world) really is. This should make you stop and think. The whole Earth is just a speck. Your home? A tiny corner of that speck. The people who might praise you there? So few, and frankly, pretty insignificant in the grand scheme.\n\n    So, final point: remember to retreat into this \u0027little domain\u0027 – *yourself*. Most importantly: don\u0027t get stressed out or feel tortured by external stuff. Be free. Look at things like a man, a human being, a citizen, a mortal creature. And out of all the truths ready at hand, keep these two front and center: **One:** External things don\u0027t actually *touch* your mind; they just stand there, outside, unmoved. Disturbances come only from the *judgment* you make inside. **Two:** Everything you see is changing right now and will soon cease to exist. Constantly think about how many changes you\u0027ve already witnessed.\n\n    The Universe *is* change; life *is* your perception and judgment (opinion).\n\n4.  **We\u0027re All Connected by Reason**\n    If Mind (the capacity for reason) is common to all of us, then the Reason *by which* we are rational beings is also common. If that\u0027s true, then the Reason that tells us what to do and what not to do is also common. If *that\u0027s* true, then the fundamental Law is common. If that\u0027s true, we are all citizens. If that\u0027s true, we share in one single system or constitution. If *that\u0027s* true, the Universe is basically one big Commonwealth or City. Because what other shared government could possibly include the entire human race? And it\u0027s from this Common City – the Cosmos – that we get our very mind, our reason, and our sense of law. Where else? Just like the earthy part of me comes from *some* earth, the watery part from *some* water, the air/spirit part from *some* source, and the fiery/hot part from *its* own source (because nothing comes from nothing, and nothing vanishes into nothing), so too the Mind must come from *some* universal Source.\n\n5.  **Death \u003d Birth \u003d Natural Mystery**\n    Death is basically like birth – just another one of Nature\u0027s mysteries. It\u0027s elements combining (birth) and then dissolving back into the same elements (death). Generally speaking, there\u0027s nothing shameful about this. It doesn\u0027t contradict being a rational creature or the fundamental principles of our design.\n\n6.  **Expect Figs to Have Juice (Expect People to Be People)**\n    Certain outcomes are the natural and necessary result of certain kinds of beings. Someone acting like an asshole? That\u0027s what assholes *do*. Wishing it wasn\u0027t so is like wishing a fig tree didn\u0027t produce its sharp juice. It\u0027s pointless. Just accept the nature of things. And always remember this: in a very short time, both you and that person will be dead. And a little while after that, nobody will even remember either of your names.\n\n7.  **Drop the Judgment, Drop the Hurt**\n    Get rid of the judgment, \"I have been harmed.\" Once you do that, you get rid of the *feeling* of having been harmed. Get rid of the feeling, and you get rid of the harm itself. It lives in your judgment.\n\n8.  **What Doesn\u0027t Make You Worse, Doesn\u0027t Harm You**\n    Whatever doesn\u0027t make *you* a worse person (less just, temperate, courageous, wise) cannot make your *life* worse, and it doesn\u0027t truly harm you, externally or internally.\n\n9.  **Nature\u0027s Benefit is Necessary**\n    It\u0027s a law of necessity that what is naturally beneficial *had* to happen this way for the good of the whole system.\n\n10. **Everything Happens Justly (If You Look Right)**\n    \"All that comes to pass, comes to pass with justice.\" If you watch carefully, you\u0027ll find this is true. I don\u0027t just mean \u0027in the right sequence,\u0027 but according to fundamental fairness, as if distributed by someone assigning things based on true worth or cosmic balance. So, keep observing as you\u0027ve begun, and whatever you do, do it with this in mind: act with *goodness*, the specific kind of goodness that defines a truly good person. Preserve this quality in everything.\n\n11. **See Reality, Not Their Spin**\n    Don\u0027t look at things the way the person doing wrong sees them, or the way they *want* you to see them. See things as they *actually are*, in truth.\n\n12. **Two Prep Steps: Act Right, Be Correctable**\n    Always be ready in these two ways: **First**, only act as Reason (your inner king and lawgiver) dictates, specifically for the benefit of mankind. **Second**, be ready to change your course *if* someone corrects you and guides you away from a mistaken notion. But—and this is key—that correction must come from a conviction of *justice* or the *common good*. Don\u0027t change your mind just because the alternative seems pleasant or popular.\n\n13. **Got Reason? Use It!**\n    \"You possess Reason?\" \"Yes, I do!\" \"Then why the hell aren\u0027t you using it? If this faculty is doing its job, what else could you possibly need?\"\n\n14. **Part of the Whole, Back to the Source**\n    You came into existence as a part of the Whole. You will eventually vanish back into that which gave you birth. Or rather, you\u0027ll be taken up and transformed back into its creative, generative Reason through the process of change.\n\n15. **Incense on the Altar**\n    Imagine many grains of incense tossed onto the same altar. One falls and burns up first, another falls later. Is there any real difference between them? Nope. Same with life and death.\n\n16. **Ten Days to Godhood (Metaphorically)**\n    Stick to your core principles and maintain reverence for Reason (the Logos/Word) consistently. Within ten days, even those people who currently see you as a brute or a fool might start looking at you like you\u0027re some kind of god. Transformation happens when you get serious and stay consistent.\n\n17. **Live NOW, Not Later**\n    Stop acting like you\u0027re going to live for ten thousand years. Fate hangs over your head. While you\u0027re alive, while you still *can*, become a good person. Do it now.\n\n18. **Inner Focus Brings Peace**\n    Think how much hassle and mental energy you save when you stop obsessing over what your neighbor says, does, or thinks, and focus *only* on what *you yourself* are doing. Make sure your own actions are just and holy, aligned with the conduct of a good person. Don\u0027t get distracted looking at \"black characters\" (bad examples). Run straight toward the finish line, stay balanced, don\u0027t flail about.\n\n19. **The Joke of Posthumous Fame**\n    The guy freaking out about his reputation after death fails to realize that every single person who remembers him will *also* die very soon. Then the person who remembers *them* will die, and so on, until the entire memory is extinguished like a line of candles blowing out one by one. Okay, let\u0027s pretend the rememberers *and* the memory somehow last forever. So what? What does that have to do with *you* now? And I\u0027m not just saying it\u0027s useless to the dead; what good is praise even to the *living*, except maybe for some practical advantage (like networking or getting a promotion)? By chasing fame, you\u0027re foolishly neglecting the *real* gift of Nature right now – your own inner worth – which doesn\u0027t depend on anyone else\u0027s testimony.\n\n20. **True Beauty Needs No Praise**\n    Anything that is truly beautiful or excellent is so *in itself*. It finds its completion in itself. Praise is not part of its essence. Whatever gets praised doesn\u0027t become better or worse because of it. This applies to things commonly called beautiful too, like materials or works of art. What does something *truly* beautiful lack? Nothing. It\u0027s complete. Same goes for Law, Truth, Kindness, or Self-Respect. Is any of these beautiful *because* it\u0027s praised, or ruined *because* it\u0027s blamed? Does an emerald become less valuable if nobody compliments it? What about gold, ivory, purple dye, a lyre, a sword blade, a flower bud, a small plant? Their quality is inherent.\n\n21. **Cosmic Recycling (Souls \u0026 Matter)**\n    Someone asks: \"If souls persist, how does the atmosphere hold them all eternally?\" Counter: \"How does the earth hold all the bodies buried over ages?\" Just as change and dissolution make room for new bodies on earth, maybe souls in the air also change, dissolve, get poured out, and reignited—absorbed back into the Universe\u0027s generative principle (creative energy)—making room for the next batch. That\u0027s one possible answer, *if* souls persist. But consider not just buried bodies, but all the animals eaten daily by us and other creatures! A huge number get consumed, effectively \u0027buried\u0027 in the eaters\u0027 bodies. Yet there\u0027s room because they transform into blood, air, heat. How do we investigate this? By distinguishing between the material aspect and the causal principle (the \u0027what\u0027 and the \u0027why/how\u0027).\n\n22. **No Aimless Wandering (Mental or Physical)**\n    Don\u0027t drift without purpose. In every impulse to act, ensure it aligns with justice. In every thought and imagination, maintain clear understanding and accurate perception.\n\n23. **Alignment with the Universe**\n    Everything that is fitting for you, my Universe, is fitting for me. Nothing that happens in your good timing is too early or too late for me. Everything your seasons bear, Nature, is fruit for me. All things come from you, exist in you, return to you. The poet might sing, \"Dear city of Cecrops (Athens)!\" Will you not say, with even more feeling, \"Dear city of God (the Cosmos)!\"?\n\n24. **Do Less, But Do What Matters**\n    Democritus advised: \"Do few things, if you want peace.\" Maybe it\u0027s even better: Do the *necessary* things, the things that the Reason of a naturally social creature dictates, and do them *as* Reason dictates. This brings peace not only from doing things *right*, but also from doing *fewer* things. If you cut out most of the unnecessary stuff we say and do, you\u0027ll have more leisure and fewer interruptions. So, on every occasion, ask yourself: \"Is this *really* necessary?\" And remove not just unnecessary actions, but unnecessary *imaginations* too, because pointless thoughts lead to pointless actions down the line.\n\n25. **Test Drive the Good Life**\n    Try it out yourself: See how well the life of the good man actually works. The man who is pleased with what the Universe assigns him and is content with his own just actions and kind disposition. See how that feels.\n\n26. **Quick Summary: Keep It Simple**\n    You\u0027ve seen all that external stuff. Now focus on this internal stuff: Don\u0027t trouble yourself. Make yourself simple. Someone does wrong? They do wrong *to themselves*. Something happens *to* you? It\u0027s fine; it was all woven into your destiny by Universal Nature from the beginning. The bottom line is this: life is short. Use the present moment profitably, with reason and justice. Be sober (clear-headed) without making it a huge struggle.\n\n27. **Order In You, Order In the Whole**\n    Is it an ordered Universe (Cosmos) or just a chaotic jumble thrown together – which, even then, still has *some* kind of order? Or, is it possible that there can be order *within you* but disorder in the *Whole*? Especially when everything is so clearly distinct, yet also interconnected and interacting sympathetically? Doesn\u0027t compute. There\u0027s an underlying order.\n\n28. **Profile of a Bad Character**\n    A \"black character\" (a corrupt heart/mind) is weak, stubborn; like a beast of prey, a brute, or a spoiled child; it\u0027s foolish, sneaky, vulgar, greedy, tyrannical.\n\n29. **Who\u0027s Lost in the Universe?**\n    If someone doesn\u0027t recognize the fundamental nature of the Universe, they\u0027re a foreigner in it. No less a foreigner is the person who doesn\u0027t recognize what *happens* in it (the natural processes). A fugitive is someone who runs away from the rational law of our shared City (the Cosmos). A blind man is someone who closes the eye of his mind. A beggar is someone who always needs something from others and lacks self-sufficiency for life\u0027s essentials. A tumor on the Universe is someone who rebels and cuts himself off from the reason of our common nature just because he\u0027s unhappy with events (remember: the Nature that produced you also produced these events). A fragment cut off from the City is someone who severs his own soul from the single soul of all rational beings.\n\n30. **Hypocrisy Check**\n    Here\u0027s a philosopher without a proper tunic, another without books, another practically naked. One says, \"I have no bread, but I still stand firm by Reason (the Word/Logos).\" And *I* have all this nourishment from my learning, yet *I* don\u0027t always stand firm. Ouch. Self-check needed.\n\n31. **Love Your Craft, Trust the Gods**\n    Love the art, the skill, the role you were taught. Set up your resting place right there. Go through the rest of your life as someone who has committed everything that is truly yours (your choices, your will) with your whole heart to the gods/Universe, and in your dealings with people, make yourself neither a tyrant over them nor a slave to any of them.\n\n32. **History Repeats: Focus on Your Role Now**\n    Think back, for example, to the time of Emperor Vespasian. You\u0027ll see the exact same things happening: people marrying, raising kids, getting sick, dying, fighting, feasting, trading, farming, flattering, being arrogant, suspecting others, plotting, praying for someone else\u0027s death, complaining about the present, being horny, hoarding wealth, desperately wanting promotions and power. Now... where is that life of theirs? Gone. Completely vanished. Okay, move on to Emperor Trajan\u0027s time. Again, exactly the same patterns. That life? Also dead. Do this exercise with other historical periods and entire nations. See how many people struggled intensely, then quickly fell and dissolved back into the elements. But most importantly, review the people *you personally knew* who got distracted by pointless vanity, neglecting to do what matched their own constitution (their nature and role), failing to just hold fast to *that* and be content with *that*. And here\u0027s a key point: remember that the attention you give to each action has its own proper value and proportion. Only by understanding this will you avoid feeling dejected if you\u0027re occupied with smaller matters, as long as you\u0027re giving them no more attention than is appropriate.\n\n33. **Fame is Fleeting, Virtue Endures**\n    Words that were common back then sound archaic now. Same for the names of heroes once praised to the skies – Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Dentatus; a bit later, Scipio and Cato; then Augustus; then Hadrian and Antoninus. They\u0027re becoming historical artifacts. Why? Because all things fade quickly, turn into myths, and then get buried completely by oblivion. And I\u0027m talking about the ones who shone like superstars! The rest? As soon as they breathed their last, they were \"unnoticed and unwept.\" And what, after all, is \"everlasting remembrance\"? Utter vanity. So, what *should* a person genuinely focus their efforts on? This one thing: right understanding, treating others decently (neighborly behavior), speech that is never false, and a disposition that welcomes everything that happens as necessary, as familiar, as flowing from the same source and fountain as oneself.\n\n34. **Surrender to Your Fate**\n    With your whole will, surrender yourself to Clotho (Fate). Let her spin your destiny into whatever web of events she chooses. Accept it fully.\n\n35. **Rememberer and Remembered Both Vanish**\n    Everything is ephemeral, lasting only a moment: both the one who remembers and the one who is remembered.\n\n36. **Nature Loves Change: Everything is Seed**\n    Continuously contemplate how *all things* come into being through change. Train yourself to think that Universal Nature loves nothing more than to change the things that exist and create new things similar to them. For everything that *is* now is, in a way, the seed of whatever will emerge from it. You probably think \u0027seeds\u0027 are just the things you put in the earth or a womb. But that\u0027s a very unscientific, limited view. Change itself is the seed process.\n\n37. **Still Not Ready? Get Simple.**\n    You\u0027re going to be dead very soon, and yet you are still not: simple, untroubled, free from the suspicion that external things can hurt you, genuinely well-disposed towards all people, nor yet convinced that wisdom consists *only* in acting justly.\n\n38. **Even the \"Wise\" Chase Trivia**\n    Look closely at the guiding principles even of people considered wise. See what petty things they avoid and what trivial things they pursue!\n\n39. **Your Evil is Your Judgment, Not Events**\n    Your \u0027evil\u0027 or \u0027harm\u0027 doesn\u0027t exist in someone else\u0027s controlling mind (governing principle), nor in any change or alteration of your environment. Where is it then? It\u0027s in the part of *you* which *forms judgments* about evil. Let that part stop making the judgment, and all is well. Even if what\u0027s closest to it – your physical body – is cut, burned, festering, or dying, let the part that *judges* these things remain at peace. That is, let it decide that nothing is truly good or evil if it can happen indifferently to both the evil man and the good man. Because whatever happens equally to someone living contrary to Nature and someone living according to Nature, that thing itself must be neutral – neither according to Nature nor contrary to it.\n\n40. **The Universe as One Organism**\n    Constantly think of the Universe as one single living creature, containing one substance and one soul. Consider how all things are absorbed into this single perception; how it does everything with a single impulse; how all things are co-causes of everything that happens; and the intricate, wonderful web and interconnectedness of it all.\n\n41. **Soul Carrying a Corpse**\n    You are a little soul carrying a corpse around, as Epictetus used to put it. (A stark reminder of the mind/body distinction).\n\n42. **Change Itself Isn\u0027t Evil or Good**\n    In the natural process of change, nothing that happens is inherently evil, just as nothing that comes *into existence* as a result of change is inherently good. It\u0027s all just transformation.\n\n43. **Time as a Raging River**\n    There\u0027s a constant flow of things coming into being, like a river, and Time is a violent torrent. No sooner is something seen than it\u0027s swept away, and another thing is carried past, and that too will soon be gone.\n\n44. **The Familiarity of Life\u0027s Events**\n    Everything that happens is as familiar and predictable as roses in spring and grapes in summer. Things like sickness, death, slander, plotting, and everything that makes foolish people either ecstatic or miserable – these are all just standard, recurring patterns.\n\n45. **Organic Connection, Not Random List**\n    What follows in time is always organically related to what came before. It\u0027s not like a random list of unrelated items simply determined by necessity. It\u0027s a rational combination. Just as Being (existence itself) is arranged in a mutually coordinated way, so too the phenomena of Becoming (things happening) display not just bare succession, but a wonderful, organic interconnectedness.\n\n46. **Heraclitus\u0027s Wisdom: Change, Logos, Wake Up!**\n    Always remember what Heraclitus taught: \"The death of earth gives birth to water, the death of water gives birth to air, the death of air gives birth to fire, and back again.\" Remember his image of the man who forgets which way he\u0027s going. And how \"people are constantly at odds with the very thing they interact with most continuously (the Logos, the Reason that governs the Universe),\" and how \"the things they encounter every day seem alien to them.\" And again: \"We must not act and speak like people who are asleep\" (because even in sleep, we think we\u0027re acting and speaking). And \"we must not be like children blindly accepting things from their parents,\" that is, accepting things simply as we\u0027ve received them without critical examination.\n\n47. **Tomorrow vs. Eternity: Tiny Difference**\n    Just as, if one of the gods told you, \"You will die tomorrow, or for sure the day after,\" you wouldn\u0027t make a huge fuss about that extra day unless you were a complete coward (because the difference is trivial). In the same way, count it as no great matter whether you live until some infinitely distant year versus just until tomorrow. Perspective matters.\n\n48. **Everyone Dies: Doctors, Stars, Cities. Live Right.**\n    Think constantly: how many physicians have died after all their worried frowning over patients? How many astrologers, after making grand predictions about other people\u0027s deaths? How many philosophers, after endless debates on death or immortality? How many great warriors, after slaughtering thousands? How many tyrants, after abusing their power over life and death with monstrous arrogance, acting as if they themselves were immortal? How many *entire cities* have effectively died: Helice, Pompeii, Herculaneum, countless others? Run over the list, too, of people *you* know, one after another. One person attended a funeral, and then was himself laid out for burial; another followed him. All in a short time. Here’s the whole point: Always see how ephemeral and cheap human affairs are – yesterday just a bit of mucus, tomorrow ashes or a mummy. Therefore, make your passage through this short span of time in obedience to Nature, and lay down your life gladly, like a ripe olive falling from the tree, blessing the Nature that produced it and grateful to the tree that gave it life.\n\n49. **Misfortune vs. Good Fortune: It\u0027s How You Bear It**\n    Be like a rocky headland against which the waves crash relentlessly. It stands firm, and the swirling waters calm down around it. Don\u0027t say, \"How unlucky I am that this happened to me!\" No, say instead: \"How *lucky* I am that, even though this happened, I continue free from sorrow, neither crushed by the present nor afraid of the future!\" Because look, something like this could have happened to anyone, but not everyone could have endured it without breaking down in sorrow. So why is the event itself more \u0027misfortune\u0027 than your resilience is \u0027good fortune\u0027? Do you generally call something a person\u0027s \u0027misfortune\u0027 if it doesn\u0027t contradict human nature? And do you think something contradicts human nature if it\u0027s not opposed to the will of that nature (i.e., Reason)? Okay, you know what that rational will is. Can this thing that happened possibly prevent you from being just, high-minded, temperate, prudent, deliberate, trustworthy, self-respecting, free, or possessing any of the other qualities which, when present, allow a person\u0027s nature to achieve its full potential? So, finally, in every situation that tempts you toward sorrow, remember to use this principle: *This event is not a misfortune, but to bear it bravely is good fortune.*\n\n50. **Clinging to Life is Pointless**\n    Here\u0027s a rough-and-ready (unscientific, maybe, but helpful) support for overcoming the fear of death: Review the cases of people who clung desperately to life. What *more* did they really gain than those who died earlier? They all ended up buried eventually: Caedicianus, Fabius, Julianus, Lepidus, and all the others like them, who carried many people to their graves and then were carried out themselves. Generally speaking, the difference in lifespan is small, and this small difference is often bought through great struggles, dealing with difficult people, and living in a frail body. So don\u0027t count that extra time as some great prize. Look at the abyss of time behind you and the infinite time stretching ahead. In that vastness, what\u0027s the real difference between an infant who lives three days and a legendary old man like Nestor who lived for three generations? Practically nothing.\n\n51. **Nature\u0027s Road is Short and Straight**\n    Always run the short road – and Nature\u0027s road *is* the short road. Therefore, say and do everything in the most sound, rational way. Sticking to this kind of purpose delivers you from troubles, conflicts, from every unnecessary care and excessive bullshit.",

      "text": "BOOK V\n\n\n1. At dawn of day, when you dislike being called, have this thought ready: \u0027I am called to man\u0027s labour; why then do I make a difficulty if I am going out to do what I was born to do and what I was brought into the world for? Is it for this that I am fashioned, to lie in bedclothes and keep myself warm?\u0027 \u0027But this is more pleasant.\u0027 \u0027Were you born then to please yourself; in fact for feeling, not for action? Can\u0027t you see the plants, the birds, the ants, the spiders, the bees each doing his own work, helping for their part to adjust a world? And then you refuse to do a man\u0027s office and don\u0027t make haste to do what is according to your own nature.\u0027 \u0027But a man needs rest as well.\u0027 I agree, he does, yet Nature assigns limits to rest, as well as to eating and drinking, and you nevertheless go beyond her limits, beyond what is sufficient; in your actions only this is no longer so, there you keep inside what is in your power. The explanation is that you do not love your own self, else surely you would love both your nature and her purpose. But other men who love their own crafts wear themselves out in labours upon them, unwashed and unfed; while you hold your own nature in less honour than the smith his metal work, the dancer his art, the miser his coin, the lover of vainglory his fame. Yet they, when the passion is on them, refuse either to eat or to sleep sooner than refuse to advance the objects they care about, whereas you imagine acts of fellowship to bring a smaller return and to be deserving of less pains.\n\n2. How simple to reject and to wipe away every disturbing or alien imagination, and straightway to be in perfect calm.\n\n3. Make up your mind that you deserve every word and work that is according to Nature, and do not allow the ensuing blame or speech of any men to talk you over; but, if it is right to be done or said, do not count yourself undeserving of it. Those others have their own selves to govern them, and use their several inclinations. Don\u0027t look round at that, but walk the straight way, following your own and the common Nature, for the path of them both is one.\n\n4. I walk in Nature\u0027s way until I shall lie down and rest, breathing my last in this from which I draw my daily breath, and lying down on this from which my father drew his vital seed, my mother her blood, my nurse her milk; from which for so many years I am fed and watered day by day; which bears my footstep and my misusing it for so many purposes.\n\n5. \u0027Your mental powers they cannot admire.\u0027 Granted! but there is much else of which you cannot say: \u0027that is no gift of mine\u0027. Bring forth then what is wholly in your power, freedom from guile, dignity, endurance of labour, distaste for pleasure, contentment with your portion, need of little, kindness, freedom, plain-living, reserve in speech, magnanimity. See you not how much you are able to bring forth, where there is no excuse of want of gift or want of facility, and yet you are content to keep a lower place? Are you obliged to grumble, to be grasping, to flatter, to blame your poor body,[1] to be obsequious, to vaunt yourself, to be tossed about in mind, because you have been fashioned without talent? No, by heaven, you had the power to be rid of all this long ago, and only, if at all, to be convicted of some slowness and tardiness of understanding; and even there you should exercise yourself, not disregarding your faults nor finding satisfaction in your dullness.\n\n6. One kind of man, when he does a good turn to some one, is forward also to set down the favour to his account. Another is not forward to do this, but still within himself he thinks as though he were a creditor and is conscious of what he has done. A third is in a sense not even conscious of what he has done, but he is like a vine which has borne grapes, and asks nothing more when once it has borne its appropriate fruit. A horse runs, a hound tracks, bees make honey, and a man does good, but doesn\u0027t know that he has done it and passes on to a second act, like a vine to bear once more its grapes in due season. You ought then to be one of these who in a way are not aware of what they do. \u0027Yes, but one ought to be aware precisely of this; for\u0027, he argues, \u0027it is a mark of the social being to perceive that he is acting socially, and to want his neighbour to perceive it too. \u0027What you are saying is true, but you take what is now meant in the wrong way; because of this you will be one of those whom I mentioned above, for they, too, are led astray by a kind of plausible reasoning. But if you make up your mind to understand what is meant, do not be afraid of omitting thereby any social act.\u0027\n\n7. A prayer of the people of Athens: \u0027Rain, beloved Zeus, rain on the cornfields and the plains of Attica.\u0027 One ought to pray thus simply and freely, or not to pray at all.\n\n8. We commonly say: \u0027Aesculapius ordered a man horse-exercise, cold baths, or no shoes\u0027; similarly we might say: \u0027Universal Nature ordered him sickness, disablement, loss or some other affliction.\u0027 In the former phrase \u0027ordered\u0027 virtually means \u0027laid this down for him as appropriate to health\u0027; in the latter what befits every man has been laid down for him as appropriate to the natural order. So, too, we say things \u0027befit us\u0027 as workmen talk of squared blocks \u0027fitting\u0027 in walls or pyramids, bonding with one another in a definite structure. For in the whole of things there is one connecting harmony, and as out of all material bodies the world is made perfect into a connected body, so out of all causes the order of Nature is made perfect into one connected cause. Even quite simple folk have in their minds what I am saying, for they use the phrase; \u0027it was sent to him\u0027; and so this was \u0027sent\u0027 to him, that is, \u0027this was ordered for him.\u0027 Accordingly let us accept these orders as we accept what Aesculapius orders. Many of them, too, are assuredly severe, yet we welcome them in hopes of health. Let the performance and completion of the pleasure of the Universal Nature seem to you to be your pleasure, precisely as the conduct of your health is seen to be, and so welcome all that comes to pass, even though it appear rather cruel, because it leads to that end, to the health of the universe, that is to the welfare and well-being of Zeus. For he would not \u0027send\u0027 this to one, if it were not to the well-being of the whole, no more than any living principle you may choose \u0027sends\u0027 anything which is not appropriate to what is governed by it. Thus there are two reasons why you must be content with what happens to you: first because it was for you it came to pass, for you it was ordered and to you it was related, a thread of destiny stretching back to the most ancient causes; secondly because that which has come to each individually is a cause of the welfare and the completion and in very truth of the actual continuance of that which governs the Whole. For the perfect Whole is mutilated if you sever the least part of the contact and continuity alike of its causes as of its members; and you do this so far as in you lies, whenever you are disaffected, and in a measure you are destroying it.\n\n9. Don\u0027t be disgusted, don\u0027t give up, don\u0027t be impatient if you do not carry out entirely conduct based in every detail upon right principles; but after a fall return again, and rejoice if most of your actions are worthier of human character. Love that to which you go back, and don\u0027t return to Philosophy as to a schoolmaster, but as a man with sore eyes to the sponge and salve, as another to a poultice, another to a fomentation. For so you will show that to obey Reason is no great matter but rather you will find rest in it. Remember, too, that philosophy wills nothing else than the will of your own nature, whereas you were willing some other thing not in accord with Nature. For what is sweeter than this accord? Does not pleasure overcome us just by sweetness? Well, see whether magnanimity, freedom, simplicity, consideration for others, holiness are not sweeter; for what is sweeter than wisdom itself when you bear in mind the unbroken current in all things of the faculty of understanding and knowledge?\n\n10. Realities are so veiled, one might say, from our eyes that not a few and those not insignificant thinkers thought them to be incomprehensible, while even the Stoics think them difficult of comprehension; and all our assent to perceptions is liable to alter. For where is the infallible man to be met? Pass on, then, to objects of experience—how short their duration, how cheap, and able to be in the possession of the bestial, the harlot, or the brigand. Next pass to the characters of those who live with you, even the best of whom it is hard to suffer, not to say that it is hard for a man even to endure himself. In such a fog and filth, in so great a torrent of being and time and movement and moving things, what can be respected or be altogether the object of earnest pursuit I do not see. On the contrary, one must console oneself by awaiting Nature\u0027s release, and not chafing at the circumstances of delay, but finding repose only in two things: one, that nothing will befall me which is not in accordance with the nature of the Whole; the other, that it is in my power to do nothing contrary to my God and inward Spirit; for there is no one who shall force me to sin against this.\n\n11. \u0027To what purpose, then, am I now using my soul?\u0027 In every case ask yourself this question and examine yourself: \u0027What have I now in this part which men call the governing part, and whose soul have I at present? A child\u0027s, a boy\u0027s, a woman\u0027s, a despot\u0027s, a dumb animal\u0027s, a dangerous beast\u0027s?\u0027\n\n12. You could apprehend the character of what the majority of men fancy to be \u0027goods\u0027 like this. If a man were to conceive the existence of real goods, like wisdom, temperance, justice, fortitude, he could not with those in his mind still listen to the popular proverb about \u0027goods in every corner\u0027, for it will not fit. But with what appear to the majority of men to be goods in his mind he will listen to and readily accept what the comic poet said as an appropriate witticism. In this way even the majority perceive the difference, otherwise this proverb would not in the one case offend and be disclaimed, whereas in the case of wealth and the blessings which lead to luxury or show we accept it as a witticism to fit the case. Go on, then, and ask whether one should respect and conceive to be good, things to which when one has thought of them one could properly apply the proverb that their owner is so well off that he \u0027has not a corner where to ease himself\u0027.\n\n13. I was composed of a formal and a material substance; and of these neither will pass away into nothingness, just as neither came to exist out of nothingness. Thus, every part of me will be assigned its place by change into some part of the Universe, and that again into another part of the Universe, and so on to infinity. By a similar change both my parents and I came to exist, and so on to another infinity of regression. For there is no reason to prevent one speaking so, even if the Universe is governed according to finite periods (of coming to be and passing away).\n\n14. Reason and the method of reasoning are abilities, sufficient to themselves and their own operations. Thus, they start from their appropriate principle and proceed to their proposed end; wherefore reasonable acts are called right acts, to indicate the rightness of their path.\n\n15. A man ought to treasure none of these things, which does not fall to a man\u0027s portion qua man. They are not requirements of a man, nor does man\u0027s nature profess them, nor are they accomplishments of man\u0027s nature. Accordingly man\u0027s end does not lie in them, and certainly not the good which is complementary to his end. Moreover, if any of these were given as his portion to man, it would not have been his portion to disdain them and to resist them, nor would the man who made himself independent of them have been laudable nor the man who took less of them than he might, have been good, if they were really \u0027goods\u0027. But as things are, the more a man robs himself of these and other such, the more he forbears when he is robbed of them, so much the more is he good.\n\n16. As are your repeated imaginations so will your mind be, for the soul is dyed by its imaginations. Dye it, then, in a succession of imaginations like these: for instance, where it is possible to live, there also it is possible to live well: but it is possible to live in a palace, ergo it is also possible to live well in a palace. Or once more: a creature is made for that in whose interest it was created: and that for which it was made, to this it tends: and to what it tends, in this is its end: and where its end is, there is the advantage and the good alike of each creature: therefore fellowship is the good of a reasonable creature. For it has been proved long ago that we are born for fellowship; or was it not plain that the inferior creatures are in the interests of the superior, the superior of one another? But the animate are superior to the inanimate and the reasoning to the merely animate.\n\n17. To pursue the impossible is madness: but it is impossible for evil men not to do things of this sort.\n\n18. Nothing befalls anything which that thing is not naturally made to bear. The same experience befalls another, and he is unruffled and remains unharmed; either because he is unaware that it has happened or because he exhibits greatness of soul. Is it not strange that ignorance and complaisance are stronger than wisdom . . .?\n\n19. Things as such do not touch the soul in the least: they have no avenue to the soul nor can they turn or move it. It alone turns and moves itself, and it makes what is submitted to it resemble the judgements of which it deems itself deserving.\n\n20. In one relation man is the nearest creature to ourselves, so far as we must do them good and suffer them. But so far as they are obstacles to my peculiar duties, man becomes something indifferent to me as much as sun or wind or injurious beast. By these some action might be hindered, but they are not hindrances to my impulse and disposition, because of my power of reservation and adaptation; for the understanding adapts and alters every obstacle to action to suit its object, and a hindrance to a given duty becomes a help, an obstacle in a given path a furtherance.\n\n21. Reverence the sovereign power over things in the Universe; this is what uses all and marshals all. In like manner, too, reverence the sovereign power in yourself; and this is of one kind with that. For in you also this is what uses the rest, and your manner of living is governed by this.\n\n22. What is not injurious to the city does not injure the citizens either. On the occasion of every imagination that you have been injured apply this canon: \u0027If the city is not injured by this neither am I injured.\u0027 But if the city is injured you must not be angry, only point out to him who injures the city what he has failed to see.\n\n23. Repeatedly dwell on the swiftness of the passage and departure of things that are and of things that come to be. For substance is like a river in perpetual flux, its activities are in continuous changes, and its causes in myriad varieties, and there is scarce anything which stands still, even what is near at hand; dwell, too, on the infinite gulf of the past and the future, in which all things vanish away. Then how is he not a fool who in all this is puffed up or distracted or takes it hardly, as if he were in some lasting scene, which has troubled him for long?\n\n24. Call to mind the whole of Substance of which you have a very small portion, and the whole of time whereof a small hair\u0027s breadth has been determined for you, and of the chain of causation whereof you are how small a link.\n\n25. Another does wrong. What is that to me? Let him look to it; he has his own disposition, his own activity. I have now what Universal Nature wills me to have, and I do what my own nature wills me to do.\n\n26. See that the governing and sovereign part of your soul is undiverted by the smooth or broken movement in the flesh, and let it not blend therewith, but circumscribe itself, and limit those affections within the (bodily) parts. But when they are diffused into the understanding by dint of that other sympathy, as needs must be in a united system, then you must not try to resist the sensation, which is natural, yet the governing part must not of itself add to the affection the judgement that it is either good or bad.\n\n27. \u0027Live with the gods.\u0027 But he is living with the gods who continuously exhibits his soul to them, as satisfied with its dispensation and doing what the deity, the portion of himself which Zeus has given to each man to guard and guide him, wills. And this deity is each man\u0027s mind and reason.\n\n28. Are you angry with the man whose person or whose breath is rank? What will anger profit you? He has a foul mouth, he has foul armpits; there is a necessary connexion between the effluvia and its causes. \u0027Well, but the creature has reason, and can, if he stops to think, understand why he is offensive.\u0027 Bless you! and so too have you reason; let reasonable disposition move reasonable disposition; point it out, remind him; for if he hearkens, you will cure him and anger will be superfluous. You are neither play-actor nor harlot.\n\n29. As you intend to live when you depart, so you are able to live in this world; but if they do not allow you to do so, then depart this life, yet so as if you suffered no evil fate. The chimney smokes and I leave the room. Why do you think it a great matter? But while no such reason drives me out, I remain a free tenant and none shall prevent me acting as I will, and I will what agrees with the nature of a reasonable and social creature.\n\n30. The mind of the Whole is social. Certainly it has made the inferior in the interests of the superior and has connected the superior one with another. You see how it has subordinated, co-ordinated, and allotted to each its due and brought the ruling creatures into agreement one with another.\n\n31. How have you hitherto borne yourself to gods, parents, brother, wife, children, masters, tutors, friends, connexions, servants? Has your relation to all men hitherto been: \u0027not to have wrought nor to have said a lawless thing to any\u0027? Remind yourself of the kinds of things you have passed through and the kinds you have had strength to endure; that the story of your life is written and your service accomplished. How many beautiful things have been revealed, how many pleasures and pains you have looked down upon, how many ambitions ignored, to how many unkind persons you have been kind!\n\n32. Why do the ignorant and unlearned confound men of knowledge and learning? What soul has knowledge and learning? That which knows the beginning and end and the reason which informs the whole substance and through all eternity governs the Whole according to appointed cycles.\n\n33. In how short a time, ashes or a bare anatomy, and either a name or not even a name; and if a name, then a sound and an echo. And all that is prized in life empty, rotten, and petty; puppies biting one another, little children quarrelling, laughing, and then soon crying. And Faith, Self-respect, Right, and Truth\n\n\u0027fled to Olympus from the spacious earth\u0027.\n\nWhat, then, still keeps one here, if the sensible is ever-changing, never in one stay, the senses blurred and subject to false impressions; the soul itself an exhalation from blood, and a good reputation in such conditions vanity? What shall we say? Wait in peace, whether for extinction or a change of state; and until its due time arrives, what is sufficient? What else than to worship and bless the gods, to do good to men, to bear them and to forbear; and, for all that lies within the limits of mere flesh and spirit, to remember that this is neither yours nor in your power?\n\n34. You are able always to have a favourable tide, if you are able to take a right path, if, that is, you are able both to conceive and to act with rectitude. These two things are common to God\u0027s soul and to man\u0027s, that is, to the soul of every reasonable creature: not to be subject to another\u0027s hindrance, to find his good in righteous act and disposition, and to terminate his desire in what is right.\n\n35. If this is neither evil of mine nor action which results from evil of mine, and if the Universe is not injured, why am I troubled because of it? And what injury is there to the Universe?\n\n36. Don\u0027t be carried away by imagination which sees only the surface, but help men as best you may and as they deserve, even though their loss be of something indifferent. Do not, however, imagine the loss to be an injury, for that habit is bad. Like the old man who, when he went away, used to ask for his foster-child\u0027s top, but did not forget that it was a top; so you should act also in this instance. And so you are lamenting in the pulpit! Have you forgotten, my friend, what these things were worth? \u0027I know, but to the sufferers they were of vast importance.\u0027 Is that a reason why you should make a fool of yourself too?\n\n37. \u0027There was a time when I was fortune\u0027s favourite, wherever and whenever she visited me.\u0027 Yes, but to be fortune\u0027s favourite meant assigning good fortune to yourself; and good fortune means good dispositions of the soul, good impulses, good actions.",

      "text": "Alright, time for the \"bro version\" of Book 5. Let\u0027s get into it.\n\n---\n\n**Meditations: Book 5 - The Bro Version**\n\n1.  **Get Out of Bed, Do Your Job**\n    Crack of dawn, alarm goes off (or someone calls you), and you really don\u0027t want to get up? Have this thought ready: \"I\u0027m being called to do *human* work. Why am I bitching about going to do the very thing I was born for, the reason I was put on this earth? Was I made just to snuggle under the covers and stay warm?\" \"Yeah, but this feels nicer!\" \"Seriously? Were you born for *pleasure*? For *feeling* good, instead of *acting*? Look at the plants, birds, ants, spiders, bees – they\u0027re all busting their asses, doing their specific jobs, contributing to the order of the world. And *you\u0027re* refusing to do the work of a human being? You won\u0027t jump up and do what your own nature demands?\" \"Okay, okay, but people need rest too!\" Fine, I agree. But Nature sets limits on rest, just like on eating and drinking. And *you* constantly go *beyond* those limits, past what\u0027s enough. Except when it comes to *actions* – there, you stay *inside* your potential, doing less than you could. Why? Because you don\u0027t truly love yourself. If you did, you\u0027d love your nature and its purpose. Look at other guys who love their crafts – they wear themselves out working, skipping meals, not showering. But you honor your *own* nature *less* than the blacksmith honors his metal, the dancer his moves, the greedy dude his cash, the attention whore his fame. When *they\u0027re* passionate, they blow off food and sleep to advance their goals. But *you* think acts of teamwork and contributing to society are less valuable and deserve less effort? Weak.\n\n2.  **Wipe the Slate Clean**\n    How easy is it to just reject and erase every distracting or messed-up thought, and instantly achieve perfect calm? Super easy. Do it.\n\n3.  **Own Your Actions, Ignore the Haters**\n    Convince yourself you *deserve* every word and action that aligns with Nature (Reason). Don\u0027t let anyone\u0027s blame or gossip talk you out of it. If it\u0027s the right thing to do or say, don\u0027t second-guess yourself or feel unworthy. Those other people have their own internal drivers, their own agendas. Don\u0027t get sidetracked looking at them. Just walk your straight path, following your own Nature and the common Nature (of the Universe) – because ultimately, their path is one and the same.\n\n4.  **Walking Nature\u0027s Path Back Home**\n    I walk the path Nature sets out until I lie down and rest. My last breath will go back into the air I draw from daily. I\u0027ll lie down on the earth from which my father got his seed, my mother her blood, my nurse her milk. The same earth that\u0027s fed and watered me day after day for years, that supports my footsteps and puts up with me using it for countless purposes (some probably not great).\n\n5.  **You Have Power, Use It - No Excuses**\n    \"Okay, fine, maybe my raw intelligence isn\u0027t super impressive.\" Granted! But there\u0027s a shit-ton of other qualities you *can\u0027t* say you weren\u0027t gifted with. So, bring forth what is *totally* in your power: honesty, dignity, endurance, resisting cheap pleasures, being content with your lot, needing little, kindness, freedom, simplicity, being reserved in speech (not gossiping), magnanimity (big-heartedness). Don\u0027t you see how much you *can* offer, where there\u0027s zero excuse about lacking talent or ability? And yet, you\u0027re still content playing in the minor leagues? Are you forced to complain, be greedy, flatter people, blame your body for your failings, suck up, brag, be mentally scattered *because* you weren\u0027t born a genius? Hell no! By the gods, you could have ditched all that crap long ago. The only possible valid excuse might be some slowness in understanding, but even *that* is something you can train and work on. Don\u0027t ignore your faults or get comfortable being dull.\n\n6.  **Doing Good: Three Levels**\n    Type 1 guy: Does someone a favor, then immediately chalks it up like he\u0027s owed something.\n    Type 2 guy: Doesn\u0027t explicitly ask for payback, but internally thinks of himself as a creditor and is very aware of the \u0027good deed\u0027 he did.\n    Type 3 guy: Is almost *unconscious* of having done the good deed. He\u0027s like a grapevine that produces grapes – it just does its thing and asks nothing more once it\u0027s borne its natural fruit. A horse runs, a dog hunts, bees make honey, a good man does good – he doesn\u0027t even realize he\u0027s done it, he just moves on to the next right action, like the vine producing grapes again next season. You should aim to be like Type 3, the ones who act virtuously without even thinking about it. \"Yeah, but,\" someone argues, \"you *should* be aware! It\u0027s part of being social to recognize you\u0027re acting socially, and you should want your neighbor to recognize it too!\" Okay, what you\u0027re saying has a grain of truth, but you\u0027re twisting the real meaning here. If you think like that, you\u0027ll end up like Type 1 or 2, fooled by plausible-sounding but flawed reasoning. If you truly understand the core principle (act virtuously for its own sake), don\u0027t worry – you won\u0027t accidentally stop doing good social acts just because you\u0027re not keeping score.\n\n7.  **Pray Simply or Not At All**\n    The Athenians had a prayer: \"Rain, dear Zeus, rain on the fields and plains of Athens.\" That\u0027s how you should pray – simply, directly, freely. Or just don\u0027t pray. No complex bargaining or whining.\n\n8.  **Accepting Your \u0027Prescription\u0027 from Nature**\n    We say, \"The doctor (Aesculapius) ordered this guy horse riding, or cold baths, or to go barefoot.\" Similarly, we should say, \"Universal Nature ordered this person sickness, or disability, or loss, or some other difficulty.\" In the doctor example, \u0027ordered\u0027 means \u0027prescribed this as fitting for health.\u0027 In the Nature example, whatever happens to each person has been assigned to them as fitting for the universal order. We talk about things \u0027befitting\u0027 us, just like builders talk about squared stones \u0027fitting\u0027 together in a wall or pyramid, bonding perfectly. The whole universe is one harmonious system. Just as the physical world is made of matter perfectly connected, the chain of causes (Fate/Destiny) is one perfect, connected sequence. Even regular folks get this; they say, \"It was sent to him,\" meaning \"This was ordered/assigned for him.\" So, let\u0027s accept these \u0027orders\u0027 from Nature just like we accept the doctor\u0027s orders. Yeah, many of Nature\u0027s prescriptions are tough, but we welcome them hoping for health. Learn to see the fulfillment of Universal Nature\u0027s plan as *your* pleasure, just like you see following health advice as ultimately good for you. Welcome *everything* that happens, even if it seems harsh, because it leads to the ultimate goal: the health of the whole universe, the well-being of Zeus (the Governing Principle). Nature wouldn\u0027t \u0027send\u0027 something to an individual if it wasn\u0027t also for the good of the whole system – just like any governing principle only dictates what\u0027s appropriate for the thing it governs. Two big reasons to be content with what happens: **First**, it happened *for you*, was ordered *for you*, related *to you*, woven into your destiny from the most ancient causes. **Second**, what happens to each individual is a *cause* contributing to the welfare, completion, and very continuation of the Governing Principle of the Whole. The whole system gets damaged if you cut even the smallest connection or break the continuity of causes or parts. And you *do* cut it off, as much as you can, whenever you get pissed off and resistant – you\u0027re basically trying to destroy the system.\n\n9.  **Fell Down? Get Back Up. Love the Process.**\n    Don\u0027t get disgusted with yourself, don\u0027t quit, don\u0027t get impatient just because you don\u0027t perfectly execute actions based on right principles *every single time*. When you stumble, get back up. Rejoice if *most* of your actions are worthy of a decent human being. Love the philosophy you\u0027re returning to. Don\u0027t go back to it like a kid grudgingly going back to a strict teacher. Go back like someone with sore eyes reaching for the soothing sponge and ointment, or someone applying a comforting poultice or fomentation. See it that way, and you\u0027ll realize obeying Reason isn\u0027t some huge burden; it\u0027s where you find *rest*. Remember: Philosophy only wants what your own nature wants. *You* were the one wanting something else, something out of sync with Nature. Because what\u0027s sweeter than being in sync? Doesn\u0027t pleasure hook us precisely because it\u0027s \u0027sweet\u0027? Well, consider this: aren\u0027t magnanimity, freedom, simplicity, consideration for others, holiness even *sweeter*? And what\u0027s sweeter than Wisdom itself, when you realize the smooth, unbroken flow of understanding and knowledge it brings?\n\n10. **Reality is Fuzzy, People Suck, Find Rest Inside**\n    Realities are kinda veiled, man. So much so that plenty of smart thinkers (not just randos) thought reality was unknowable. Even the Stoics admit it\u0027s tough to grasp fully. All our perceptions, our \u0027assent\u0027 to things, are shaky and changeable. Where\u0027s the guy who\u0027s never wrong? Doesn\u0027t exist. Okay, shift focus to objects of experience – look how short-lived they are, how cheap, how easily possessed by degenerates, prostitutes, or criminals. Next, consider the characters of the people you live with. Even the best ones are hard to put up with sometimes. Hell, it\u0027s hard enough to put up with *yourself*. In such a fog and muck, in this raging torrent of existence, time, motion, and things moving – what can possibly be worthy of deep respect or serious pursuit? I honestly don\u0027t see it. Instead, you gotta console yourself by patiently waiting for Nature\u0027s release (death), not stressing about the delay. Find peace *only* in two things: **One**, nothing will happen to me that isn\u0027t in accordance with the Nature of the Whole Universe. **Two**, it is totally within my power *not* to do anything contrary to my own God and inner Spirit (Reason); nobody can force me to violate that.\n\n11. **Whose Soul Are You Using Right Now?**\n    \"What purpose am I using my soul for right now?\" Ask yourself this constantly. Examine: \"What\u0027s going on in this part they call the \u0027governing self\u0027? Whose soul do I currently have active? A child\u0027s? A teenager\u0027s? A woman\u0027s (stereotype alert!)? A tyrant\u0027s? A farm animal\u0027s? A dangerous predator\u0027s?\" Be honest about your current mental state.\n\n12. **True Goods vs. Fake Goods**\n    You can spot what most people *think* are \u0027goods\u0027 by this test: Imagine someone possessing *real* goods – wisdom, self-control, justice, courage. Could that person seriously listen to that crude popular saying about being so rich you \u0027don\u0027t have a corner to take a shit in\u0027? No way, it wouldn\u0027t fit. But if someone has their mind full of what the *majority* considers goods (wealth, luxury, status symbols), they\u0027ll hear that same saying from a comedian and laugh, thinking it\u0027s totally appropriate. See? Even the average person dimly senses the difference. Otherwise, the saying wouldn\u0027t be offensive in the first case (real goods) but accepted as witty in the second (fake goods). So go ahead, ask yourself: should you really respect and consider things \u0027good\u0027 if, once you possess them, that crude proverb about having no place left to relieve yourself actually seems fitting?\n\n13. **Eternal Recycling: Form \u0026 Matter**\n    I\u0027m made of Form (rational principle) and Matter (physical stuff). Neither of these will vanish into nothing, just like neither came from nothing. So, every part of me will eventually be reassigned by change into some *other* part of the Universe, and that part will change into another, and so on, forever. My parents came into existence through a similar change process, and their parents before them, stretching back infinitely. No reason not to say this, even if the Universe operates in finite cycles of creation and destruction (the changes still happen within or between cycles).\n\n14. **Reason is Self-Sufficient**\n    Reason, and the process of reasoning, are abilities complete in themselves and their own operations. They start from their own proper foundation (first principles) and proceed towards their intended goal. That\u0027s why rational actions are called *katorthōseis* (right actions) – indicating the \u0027rightness\u0027 or \u0027straightness\u0027 of their path.\n\n15. **Only Human Goods Matter**\n    A person shouldn\u0027t treasure any of those things that don\u0027t belong to a human being *as a human being*. They aren\u0027t requirements of our nature, our nature doesn\u0027t promise them, and they aren\u0027t completions or perfections of human nature. Therefore, our ultimate purpose (end/telos) doesn\u0027t lie in them, and certainly not the \u0027good\u0027 that fulfills that purpose. Besides, if any of those external things (wealth, fame, etc.) were truly part of our essential portion, it wouldn\u0027t make sense for us to disdain them or resist them. The person who achieves independence from them wouldn\u0027t be praiseworthy, and the person who deliberately takes less wouldn\u0027t be considered good, if they were *really* \u0027Goods\u0027. But as things actually are, the more a man strips himself of these things, or bears it patiently when they\u0027re taken from him, the *better* a person he is.\n\n16. **Your Mind is Dyed by Your Thoughts**\n    Whatever you repeatedly imagine, that\u0027s what your mind will become, because the soul takes on the color of its thoughts. So, dye your soul by constantly soaking it in thoughts like these: For instance, \"Where it\u0027s possible to live, it\u0027s also possible to live *well*.\" \"But it\u0027s possible to live in a palace.\" \"Therefore, it\u0027s possible to live *well* in a palace.\" Or again: \"A creature is made *for* the sake of that purpose for which it was created.\" \"And whatever it was made for, that\u0027s what it naturally moves *towards*.\" \"And what it moves towards, that\u0027s its ultimate *end*.\" \"And where its end is, that\u0027s where its advantage and *good* lie.\" \"Therefore, fellowship (community, social cooperation) is the good of a rational creature.\" We proved long ago we\u0027re born for fellowship, right? Wasn\u0027t it obvious that inferior creatures exist for the sake of superior ones, and superior ones exist for each other? But animate beings are superior to inanimate, and rational beings are superior to merely animate ones.\n\n17. **Chasing the Impossible is Nuts**\n    Trying to achieve the impossible is madness. But it *is* impossible for bad people *not* to do the kind of bad things they do. Expecting otherwise is the madness.\n\n18. **What Doesn\u0027t Break Others Shouldn\u0027t Break You**\n    Nothing happens to anything which that thing isn\u0027t naturally equipped to bear. The same challenging experience happens to someone else, and they stay calm and unharmed – either because they don\u0027t realize its \u0027severity\u0027 or because they show great character (greatness of soul). Isn\u0027t it weird if ignorance and simple acceptance turn out to be stronger than wisdom? (Think about that.)\n\n19. **Things Don\u0027t Touch the Soul**\n    External things, as such, don\u0027t touch the soul at all. They can\u0027t get access to it, can\u0027t turn it, can\u0027t move it. The soul *alone* turns and moves itself. And it makes whatever external data it receives conform to the judgments it deems itself worthy of.\n\n20. **People: Help \u0027Em, Endure \u0027Em, Work Around \u0027Em**\n    In one sense, other people are the closest things to us – we *must* do them good and tolerate them. But, insofar as they become obstacles to my specific duties or actions, they become as indifferent to me as the sun, the wind, or a wild animal. Yes, these things might *hinder* a specific action, but they can\u0027t hinder my underlying *impulse* and *disposition*, because I have the power of \u0027reservation\u0027 (Plan B thinking) and \u0027adaptation\u0027. My understanding can adapt and reshape any obstacle to serve its purpose. A hindrance to a specific task can become a *help* (by testing virtue), an obstacle on one path can become a *furtherance* (by forcing a better path).\n\n21. **Respect the Boss (Universal \u0026 Internal)**\n    Revere the ultimate power in the Universe – the thing that uses all and directs all. Likewise, revere the governing power *in yourself*. It\u0027s the same kind of power. Because in you too, this is the faculty that uses everything else, and your way of living is directed by it.\n\n22. **City Not Harmed? Citizen Not Harmed.**\n    Whenever you imagine you\u0027ve been injured, apply this rule: \"If the community (city/polis) isn\u0027t harmed by this, then neither am I truly injured.\" But if the community *is* harmed, don\u0027t just get angry. Calmly point out to the person causing the harm what they\u0027ve failed to see (their error).\n\n23. **Everything Flows Away**\n    Repeatedly reflect on how fast things that *are* pass by and depart, and how fast things that *come to be* also pass by. Substance is like a constantly flowing river. Actions are in continuous change. Causes have infinite variations. Hardly anything stands still, even what seems close. Think also about the infinite abyss of past and future time, where everything vanishes. So, isn\u0027t he a fool who gets puffed up, stressed out, or complains bitterly about things in this fleeting reality, as if he were stuck in some long-lasting, troublesome situation?\n\n24. **Your Tiny Slice of Everything**\n    Call to mind the entirety of Substance (all matter/existence), of which you possess a tiny fragment. Call to mind the entirety of Time, of which a brief, measured span has been assigned to you. Call to mind the Chain of Causation (Fate/Destiny), of which you are just one small link.\n\n25. **He Screws Up? His Problem.**\n    Someone else does wrong. What\u0027s that to me? Let him worry about it. He has his own disposition, his own actions. I have right *now* what Universal Nature wills me to have, and I am doing right *now* what my own nature wills me to do.\n\n26. **Mind Over Matter (Literally)**\n    Make sure the governing, sovereign part of your soul isn\u0027t diverted by the sensations (smooth or rough) happening in your flesh. Don\u0027t let your mind blend with those sensations. Keep itself separate, limit those feelings to the bodily parts. But when those sensations *do* inevitably get communicated to the understanding (because body and mind are linked), don\u0027t try to *resist* the sensation itself (it\u0027s natural). However, the governing part must *not* add its own judgment that the sensation is inherently \u0027good\u0027 or \u0027bad\u0027.\n\n27. **Live With the Gods (By Living Right)**\n    \"Live with the gods.\" How? By constantly showing them your soul is satisfied with its assigned lot and is doing what the *daimon* (the inner deity, the fragment of Zeus given to guide each person) wills. And that *daimon* is each person\u0027s own Mind and Reason.\n\n28. **Dealing With Stinky People (Literally \u0026 Figuratively)**\n    Are you pissed off at the guy who has bad breath or body odor? What good will getting angry do? He has a foul mouth, foul armpits – it\u0027s a necessary consequence of certain causes. \"Okay, but the guy has reason! If he thought about it, he could understand why he\u0027s offensive!\" Bless your heart! And *you* have reason too! Let your rational disposition engage *his* rational disposition. Point it out, remind him gently. If he listens, you\u0027ll cure the issue, and anger becomes pointless. You\u0027re not here to be a drama queen or a prostitute (reacting emotionally for effect or gain).\n\n29. **Live Right Here, Or Leave Calmly**\n    The way you intend to live when you eventually \u0027depart\u0027 (die)? That\u0027s how you *can* live right here, right now. If circumstances (or people) genuinely don\u0027t allow you to live according to your principles? Fine, then exit life. But do it calmly, as if you\u0027re suffering no great evil. \"The chimney\u0027s smoking, so I leave the room.\" Why make a huge drama out of it? But as long as no such compelling reason forces me out, I remain a free citizen here, and nobody can stop me from acting as I will. And I will what aligns with the nature of a rational and social creature.\n\n30. **The Universe is Social**\n    The Mind of the Whole is inherently social. It definitely made inferior things for the sake of superior things, and it connected the superior things to each other. See how it has subordinated, coordinated, assigned each thing its proper due, and brought the ruling creatures (rational beings) into agreement with each other?\n\n31. **Life Review: How\u0027d You Do?**\n    How have you conducted yourself so far towards: gods, parents, siblings, spouse, children, bosses, teachers, friends, relatives, servants? Has your track record with everyone up till now basically been: \"Never intentionally harmed anyone or said anything unjust\"? Remind yourself what kinds of challenges you\u0027ve been through and what you\u0027ve had the strength to endure. Realize that the story of your life is already largely written, your service mostly rendered. How many beautiful things have you witnessed? How many pleasures and pains have you looked down upon (mastered)? How many ambitions have you ignored? How many unkind people have you treated with kindness?\n\n32. **Who Truly Knows?**\n    Why do ignorant and unlearned people confuse men of real knowledge and learning? What kind of soul *has* knowledge and learning? The soul that knows the beginning and the end, and understands the Reason (Logos) that permeates all substance and governs the entire Universe through all eternity according to fixed cycles.\n\n33. **Ashes, Echoes, and What Matters**\n    In such a short time: ashes or a skeleton. Maybe a name, maybe not even that. If a name, just a sound, an echo. Everything prized in life? Empty, rotten, petty. Like puppies snapping at each other. Like little kids quarreling, laughing one minute, crying the next. And Faith, Self-Respect, Justice, and Truth? They\u0027ve \u0027\"fled to Olympus from the spacious earth.\"\u0027 (Quoting Hesiod). So, what\u0027s left to keep you here? The physical world is constantly changing, never stable. Your senses are blurry, easily deceived. The soul itself is just an exhalation from blood. And a good reputation in these conditions? Vanity. What then? Wait peacefully – either for extinction or for transformation. Until that time comes, what\u0027s sufficient? What else but to worship and bless the gods, do good to fellow humans, bear with them patiently, and practice self-restraint? And as for everything that lies within the limits of mere flesh and breath – remember it\u0027s not truly yours and not in your ultimate control.\n\n34. **Favorable Tides Through Right Action**\n    You can *always* have a favorable tide (good fortune) if you can take the right path – that is, if you can consistently conceive thoughts and perform actions with rectitude (correctness/justice). Two things are common to the soul of God and the soul of man (and every rational creature): 1) Not being hindered by anything external (in terms of inner freedom). 2) Finding one\u0027s good in righteous disposition and action, and limiting one\u0027s desire to achieving that.\n\n35. **Is the Universe Harmed?**\n    If this event isn\u0027t an evil *caused by me* or an action *resulting from my own evil*, and if the Universe as a whole isn\u0027t injured by it, then why am I troubled? And what injury *is* there to the Universe anyway? (Hint: None that affects its fundamental nature).\n\n36. **Help Appropriately, Don\u0027t Catch the Drama**\n    Don\u0027t get swept away by surface appearances (imagination). Help people as best you can and as they deserve, even if their loss is just about \u0027indifferent\u0027 things (money, status, possessions). However, *do not* internalize the idea that this loss is a real *injury* to them (or you). That habit of thinking is bad. Be like the old man in the story: when he left, he\u0027d ask for his foster child\u0027s toy top back, but he never forgot it was *just a toy top*. Act like that here too. So, you\u0027re up there lamenting dramatically (like on a stage)? Friend, have you forgotten what these external things are truly worth? \"I know,\" someone says, \"but they meant so much *to them*!\" Is *that* a reason for *you* to make a fool of yourself too by adopting their flawed judgment?\n\n37. **Defining Good Fortune**\n    Someone says, \"There was a time I was Fortune\u0027s favorite, wherever she went, I benefited!\" Yeah, okay. But being \u0027Fortune\u0027s favorite\u0027 properly means *assigning good fortune to yourself*. And real good fortune means: good inner dispositions, good impulses (motivations), and good actions. That\u0027s it. That\u0027s true luck, and it\u0027s self-generated.\n\n---\n\nBook 5 wrapped! Let me know when you\u0027re ready for Book 6.",

    }, {
      "text": "Here\u0027s a breakdown of the thought process to generate the LaTeX output for the \"Bro Version\" of Meditations Books 1-5:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants the previously generated \"Bro Version\" text for Books 1 through 5 formatted as a LaTeX document. This means structuring the text with appropriate LaTeX commands for titles, sections (books), subsections (numbered points), and potentially some basic formatting like italics or bolding if needed (though the bro style doesn\u0027t heavily rely on these).\n\n2.  **Recall/Review the Content:** Access the generated \"Bro Version\" text for each book (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Ensure all numbered points within each book are present and in the correct order.\n\n3.  **Choose a Suitable LaTeX Document Class:** For a simple text document like this, `article` is the most straightforward and appropriate choice.\n\n4.  **Set Up the Preamble:**\n    *   `\\documentclass{article}`: Defines the document type.\n    *   `\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}`: Allows direct input of UTF-8 characters (like apostrophes, quotes). Essential for modern text.\n    *   `\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}`: Selects the T1 font encoding, which provides better support for hyphenation and accented characters in many languages (good practice even for English).\n    *   `\\usepackage{amsmath}`: While not strictly needed for *this* text, it\u0027s often included in LaTeX templates and provides enhanced math capabilities. Doesn\u0027t hurt to include it. (Self-correction: Actually, `amsmath` is unnecessary here. Remove it for minimalism).\n    *   `\\usepackage{geometry}`: Useful for controlling page margins. Set reasonable margins (e.g., `a4paper, margin\u003d1in`) to make the text readable.\n    *   `\\usepackage{times}`: Use the Times font for a classic, readable look, often associated with books. (Or stick with the LaTeX default Computer Modern if preferred, but Times feels slightly more \u0027bookish\u0027). Let\u0027s go with Times for this request.\n    *   `\\title{Meditations: The Bro Version (Books 1-5)}`: Sets the main title.\n    *   `\\author{Marcus Aurelius (Bro-dapted)}`: Sets the author (with a nod to the adaptation style).\n    *   `\\date{\\today}`: Automatically inserts the compilation date.\n\n5.  **Structure the Document Body:**\n    *   `\\begin{document}` and `\\end{document}`: Enclose the entire content.\n    *   `\\maketitle`: Displays the title, author, and date information defined in the preamble.\n    *   Use `\\section*{Book I}` (and subsequent books II-V): The asterisk `*` prevents numbering of the sections, which looks cleaner for book titles here. Use Roman numerals for clarity (I, II, III, IV, V).\n    *   For each numbered point within a book, use a LaTeX list environment. `enumerate` is perfect as it automatically numbers the items.\n        *   Start each book\u0027s list with `\\begin{enumerate}`.\n        *   End each book\u0027s list with `\\end{enumerate}`.\n        *   Each numbered point from the original text becomes an `\\item`.\n    *   **Handling Emphasis/Notes:** The original \"Bro Version\" included some parenthetical notes (e.g., `*(Written out near the Gran river...)*`, `*(like Pindar said)*`, `*(stereotype alert!)*`). These can be kept within the `\\item` text, perhaps using italics (`\\textit{...}`) for slight emphasis or just parentheses as they were. Let\u0027s stick with parentheses as in the original text for consistency with the established style.\n    *   **Quotes:** The original text used block quotes for the \"Core Attitudes\" in Book 1. Use the `quote` environment (`\\begin{quote}...\\end{quote}`) for these. Indent the poetic lines within the quote using standard line breaks (`\\\\`).\n    *   **Special Characters:** Ensure characters like apostrophes (`\u0027`), quotes (`\"`), and hyphens (`-`) are correctly handled by LaTeX (using `inputenc` helps, but sometimes explicit commands like `---` for em-dash or ` `` ` and ` \u0027\u0027 ` for proper quotes are better, though less critical in this informal style). For simplicity and given `inputenc`, direct input should mostly work. Double-check the output for any weird characters.\n\n6.  **Copy and Paste Text into LaTeX Structure:** Carefully transfer the text for each point into the corresponding `\\item` within the correct `\\section*` and `enumerate` environment. Pay attention to paragraph breaks within items if any exist (use a blank line in the LaTeX source).\n\n7.  **Review and Refine:**\n    *   Read through the generated LaTeX code. Check for typos, misplaced items, or incorrect nesting of environments.\n    *   Ensure section titles match the book numbers.\n    *   Verify that the `\\maketitle` command is present after `\\begin{document}`.\n    *   Confirm the preamble includes necessary packages.\n    *   Mentally compile the LaTeX – does the structure look correct?\n\n8.  **Add Explanatory Comments (Optional but Good Practice):** Include comments (`%`) in the LaTeX code to explain choices or sections, especially in the preamble.\n\n9.  **Final Output Generation:** Present the complete LaTeX code block to the user, enclosed in markdown code fences (```latex ... ```). Add a brief note explaining how to compile it (using any standard LaTeX distribution like TeX Live, MiKTeX, or an online editor like Overleaf).",

Here’s the rundown of who taught me what:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{From Grandpa Verus:} Learned how to be a decent dude and keep my cool. Basic good character and not losing my temper over dumb stuff.\n    \\item \\textbf{From my Dad’s Rep (and memory):} Humility and being a solid, reliable man. No BS, just quiet strength.\n    \\item \\textbf{From Mom:} Respect for the spiritual side of things, being generous, and steering clear of not just bad *actions*, but even toxic *thoughts*. Plus, keeping life simple, not needing all the flashy rich-guy crap.\n    \\item \\textbf{From Great-Grandpa:} Dodging the hype of big-name schools. Getting solid teachers at home was key, and realizing you gotta invest properly in good education.\n    \\item \\textbf{From my Tutor/Handler:} Not getting sucked into pointless team rivalries (like those chariot races or gladiator factions – basically, don\u0027t lose your mind over sports teams or politics). Also learned to grind, need less, do my own work, stay out of other people\u0027s drama, and ignore gossip and slander.\n    \\item \\textbf{From Diognetus:} Don\u0027t waste time on trivial crap. Ignore the snake oil salesmen, magic tricks, and superstition talk. Avoid dumb, aggressive hobbies (like fighting quails – yeah, weird). Value straight talk and getting into philosophy. Heard some solid thinkers (Bacchius, Tandasis, Marcianus). Tried writing serious stuff young. Got into that simple, tough Greek lifestyle (basic bed, minimal gear).\n    \\item \\textbf{From Rusticus:} Got the wake-up call that I seriously needed to work on myself. He steered me away from showing off intellectually, writing fluff pieces, giving cheesy motivational speeches, or making a big show of being disciplined or generous just for looks. Cut the fancy talk, poetry, and overly polished writing. Stop strutting around the house like you\u0027re on parade. Write simple, straight-up letters (like he did). Be ready to squash beefs and reconcile quick when someone messes up but wants to make it right. *Really* read stuff, don\u0027t just skim. Don\u0027t just blindly agree with loudmouths. Huge debt to him for hooking me up with Epictetus’s teachings from his own stash – game changer.\n    \\item \\textbf{From Apollonius:} Owning my choices and staying laser-focused on my goals. Always, *always* default to Reason, even for a second. Stay steady – through intense pain, losing a kid, long sicknesses. Saw in him a living example: you can be hardcore determined *and* flexible, and teach without being a cranky dick. Saw a guy who knew his real value wasn\u0027t just his smarts or teaching skills. Learned how to accept favors or help from friends without feeling weirdly indebted or just blowing it off. Handle generosity with grace.\n    \\item \\textbf{From Sextus:} Genuine kindness. Saw how a family should run – like a good dad runs it. Got the blueprint for living aligned with reality (Nature). Seriousness without being fake. How to genuinely look out for your friends. Patience with people who don\u0027t know stuff or jump to conclusions. He could connect with *anyone*; hanging with him was better than any fake flattery, yet everyone totally respected him. Dude had a knack for figuring out and organizing the core principles for living, smart and methodical. Never saw him lose his temper or get emotional – totally level-headed, but also super caring. Gave props without being loud about it, knew a ton but never showed off.\n    \\item \\textbf{From Alexander the Grammar Nerd:} Don\u0027t be that annoying guy always correcting people\u0027s minor mistakes in speaking. If someone messes up a word, don\u0027t jump on them. Just smoothly use the right word yourself in your reply, or focus the conversation back on the actual *point*, not the nitpicky details. Offer correction subtly, if at all.\n    \\item \\textbf{From Fronto:} Learned to spot the toxic traits in bad leaders (tyrants) – the envy, the two-faced crap, the hypocrisy. Realized that a lot of the \"elites\" (Patricians) are often seriously lacking in basic human decency and care.\n    \\item \\textbf{From Alexander the Platonist:} Don\u0027t constantly tell people \"I\u0027m too busy,\" either in person or writing, unless it\u0027s actually unavoidable. Stop making lame excuses about being \"too busy\" for the basic duties you owe to the people in your life.\n    \\item \\textbf{From Catulus:} Don\u0027t brush off a friend\u0027s criticism, even if it seems unfair. Try to get things back on track with them. Speak well of your mentors (like people remembered Domitius and Athenodotus). Genuinely love your kids.\n    \\item \\textbf{From my Bro Severus:} Love your family, love truth, love justice. Through him, learned about the real heroes (Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, etc. – guys who stood for principles). Got the idea of a fair society: same rules for everyone, equal rights, freedom of speech, and leaders who prioritize the people\u0027s freedom above all. Also learned from him: consistency in sticking with philosophy, being proactively good, giving freely, staying optimistic, and trusting that your friends actually like you. With him, there was no guessing game – you knew where he stood, especially if he disapproved of someone. Total transparency.\n    \\item \\textbf{From Maximus:} Self-mastery, not getting easily distracted. Staying cheerful through everything, even sickness. Having that perfect mix of being approachable/kind and having serious presence/dignity. Doing the job in front of you without whining. Everyone knew he meant what he said and never had hidden agendas. He was never shocked, never rushed, never delayed, never confused or down, never used laughter to hide being pissed off, and wasn\u0027t paranoid or overly emotional. Dude was a machine of doing good deeds, quick to forgive, zero falsehood. He wasn’t someone *trying* to be good; he just *was* fundamentally solid, couldn\u0027t be bent from what\u0027s right. Nobody felt looked down on by him, and nobody dared think they were better. Also had a great sense of humor, used it well.\n    \\item \\textbf{From my Adopted Father (Emperor Antoninus Pius):} Observed his chill temper, but absolute rock-solid resolve once he decided something thoughtfully. No ego tied up in titles and honors. Loved the work, kept grinding. Listened carefully to anyone with ideas for the common good. Always fair in giving people what they deserved. Knew from experience when to push hard and when to ease off. Saw he was completely over any weird sexual hang-ups. Didn\u0027t act like he was better than anyone else. Didn’t pressure friends into mandatory dinners or appearances; if they missed something for legit reasons, he treated them exactly the same later. Saw his deep-dive approach to decisions – always investigating fully, never satisfied with first impressions. Loyal to his friends, didn\u0027t get bored of them, but wasn\u0027t overly clingy either. Content in all situations, always positive. Planned ahead, handled details without making a fuss. Shut down fake applause and flattery instantly. Always focused on what the Empire *needed*, managed money responsibly, and took the heat for it patiently. Not superstitious, didn\u0027t try to buy popularity with gifts or pandering. Just sober, firm, never petty or obsessed with novelty. He used the good things life offered (comforts, resources) without arrogance or making excuses – enjoyed them when he had them, didn\u0027t miss them when he didn\u0027t. Nobody could call him a show-off intellectual, a spoiled brat, or a stuffy academic. Everyone saw him as mature, complete, immune to flattery, capable of handling his own shit and everyone else\u0027s. Plus, he respected genuine philosophers but didn\u0027t attack the fakes (or get fooled by them). Easy to talk to, pleasant without being fake. Took reasonable care of his health – not obsessively, not vainly, just enough that he rarely needed doctors. Super willing to yield the spotlight to experts (in law, speaking, ethics, whatever) and helped them get the recognition they deserved. Always followed tradition but without making a show of it. Not restless or flaky – liked stability, routine. Even after bad headaches, bounced right back to work. Kept very few secrets, and only crucial state matters. Prudent and responsible with public spending (games, buildings, donations) – focused on the *need*, not the applause. Didn’t do things at weird times (like bathing). Wasn\u0027t obsessed with building fancy houses, food, clothes, or attractive staff. His style was simple, practical (like his gear from his country villas). Remember that time he calmly handled the annoying tax guy at Tusculum? That was him – never harsh, never holding a grudge, never explosive, never pushed things to a breaking point. He looked at everything piece by piece, like he had all the time in the world, calmly, methodically, strongly, consistently. That famous line about Socrates fit him perfectly: he could enjoy things *or* abstain from them, unlike most guys who either can\u0027t resist or can\u0027t enjoy moderately. Being strong enough for both restraint *and* sober enjoyment? That’s the sign of a truly solid, unbeatable soul – like he showed when Maximus was sick.\n    \\item \\textbf{To the Universe/Gods/Fate:} I owe thanks for having awesome grandfathers, parents, sister, teachers, buddies, family, and friends – almost everything good. Also, thanks that I didn’t majorly screw up with any of them, even though I had the potential; circumstances just never pushed me that far (lucky break). Thankful I wasn\u0027t raised longer by my grandpa\u0027s side piece; kept my youthful innocence; didn\u0027t rush into sex, even waited. Thankful I had a ruler and father (Antoninus) who knocked any arrogance out of me and showed me you can live in a palace without needing bodyguards, fancy clothes, or statues everywhere – that a leader can live almost like a regular dude without losing authority or slacking on public duties. Thanks for a brother (Severus) whose character pushed me to keep myself in check, while also being respectful and affectionate. Thankful my kids weren\u0027t born stupid or deformed. Thankful I didn\u0027t get *too* good at rhetoric, poetry, etc. – might have gotten completely lost in them if I\u0027d seen too much early success. Thankful I acted fast to honor my mentors, didn\u0027t put it off. Thankful I knew Apollonius, Rusticus, Maximus. Thankful I got clear, repeated hits on what \"living according to Nature\" actually means – so, as far as the universe and its help goes, nothing stopped me from living that way *right now*, even though I still fall short (my own damn fault for not listening to the hints and instructions). Thankful my body’s held up this long living this kind of demanding life. Thankful I never messed around with Benedicta or Theodotus (dodged those bullets!), and got over past infatuations. Thankful that even when I was pissed at Rusticus, I never did anything I regretted later. Thankful my mom, though she died young, spent her last years with me. Thankful that whenever I wanted to help someone, I was never told \"sorry, no funds\" – and that I never *needed* to take handouts myself. Thankful for my wife – so loyal, loving, and straightforward. Thankful for plenty of good teachers for my kids. Thankful for guidance through dreams (like remedies for spitting blood and dizziness...). Thankful that when I got into philosophy, I didn\u0027t fall for some slick guru, waste time on trivial academic debates, or get lost in pointless theories. All this stuff needs cosmic help and good fortune.\n    \\\\ \\\\ (\\textit{Written) Among the Quadi tribe by the Granua river.} (Basically, out on military campaign duty).\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\newpage % Start Book 2 on a new page\n\n\\section*{Book II}\n(\\textit{Written out near the Gran river, probably freezing my ass off with the Quadi tribe nearby})\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Morning Pep Talk: Dealing with Assholes}\n    Wake up and tell yourself: Today I\u0027m gonna run into people who are nosy, ungrateful, arrogant, sneaky, jealous, and downright unpleasant. They\u0027re like this because they\u0027re clueless about what\u0027s actually good and bad. But *I* get it. I\u0027ve seen the beauty of Right and the ugliness of Wrong. I also see that the dude doing wrong is fundamentally built like me – not blood-related, but we share the same basic wiring, that spark of the divine (Reason). Because of that, none of them can *truly* mess with me, because nobody can force me to be a shitty person. And I can\u0027t stay pissed at my own kin or hate them. We\u0027re all here to work together, like feet, hands, eyelids, or rows of teeth. Getting in each other\u0027s way is totally unnatural. Getting annoyed or turning your back on someone? That\u0027s basically declaring war on the team.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Know Thyself (The Core Components)}\n    This thing I call \u0027me\u0027? It\u0027s basically three parts: Meat-sack (flesh), Spark (vital breath/spirit), and the Boss (your mind, the Governing Self). Forget the meat-sack – just blood, bones, a tangled mess of nerves and tubes. The spark? Just air, constantly cycling in and out, never the same. The third part, the Boss – *that\u0027s* the key. Ditch the books for a sec, stop getting distracted, that stuff isn\u0027t the real you. Think like you\u0027re dying right now: You\u0027re an old man. Stop letting your Boss-mind be a slave. Stop letting it get jerked around by selfish whims like a puppet. Stop bitching about your current situation or worrying about the future.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Trust the Process (Gods, Fortune, Nature)}\n    The work of the Gods (or the Universe, whatever) is driven by pure Order (Providence). Even random shit (Fortune) isn\u0027t totally separate from Nature or the grand plan woven by that Order. It all flows from that source. Plus, there\u0027s Necessity, and it all contributes to the well-being of the whole damn universe, which you\u0027re a part of. Here’s the deal: what\u0027s good for the whole system (Nature) is good for *you*, the part. And the system stays healthy through constant change – things combining, breaking down, elements shifting. Let that be enough for you. Make these your core beliefs. And seriously, ditch the desperate need to read *everything*. Aim to die without whining, genuinely chill and thankful to the powers that be.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Stop Procrastinating, Clock\u0027s Ticking}\n    Dude, remember how long you\u0027ve been putting this self-improvement shit off? How many extra days the Gods (or Fate) have given you, and you *still* haven\u0027t used them? It\u0027s way past time to realize what kind of Universe you\u0027re in, who\u0027s running the show (the Governor you stem from), and that your time here is limited. If you don\u0027t use this time to get your head straight and find inner peace, the clock runs out, *you* run out, and the chance is gone. Forever.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Hourly Check-In: Act Right}\n    Every single hour, commit – like a solid Roman, like a real man – to doing the task right in front of you. Do it with precision, real dignity (no faking), genuine kindness, freedom, and justice. And give yourself a break from all other distracting thoughts. You *can* do this, IF you tackle each action as if it were your absolute last. Free from random goals, free from willfully ignoring Reason, free from pretending, free from self-obsession, and free from bitching about what life hands you. See? It\u0027s just a few key things you need to nail to live a smooth, decent life. The Gods themselves wouldn\u0027t ask for more than this.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Stop Self-Sabotage}\n    Yo, Soul! You\u0027re doing violence to yourself, man! Real violence! And you won\u0027t get a second shot at honoring yourself properly. Life\u0027s short for everyone, and yours is almost done. Show some self-respect already! Stop putting your well-being and happiness in the hands (or minds) of other people.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Focus! Ditch Distractions \\\u0026 Aimlessness}\n    Is outside stuff constantly pulling you off track? Carve out some quiet time to learn something genuinely good and stop drifting aimlessly. But watch out for another trap: being busy but having no real *point*. Those people who are dead inside while alive, with no clear target for their efforts or thoughts? They\u0027re just screwing around, wasting time with actions as much as words.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Know Your Own Mind First}\n    You rarely see people truly screwed over just because they didn\u0027t obsess about what\u0027s going on in someone else\u0027s head. But people who don\u0027t accurately track the movements and state of their *own* mind? They are absolutely *guaranteed* to be screwed. Know yourself first.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Core Reminders: Keep These Handy}\n    Always remember:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item What\u0027s the Nature of the Big Picture (the Whole)?\n        \\item What\u0027s *my* nature?\n        \\item How does my nature relate to the Big Picture?\n        \\item What kind of part am I, of what kind of Whole?\n        \\item *Nobody* can stop you from saying and doing what aligns with the Nature you\u0027re part of.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Temper vs. Appetite: Which is Worse?}\n    My man Theophrastus hit it on the head when comparing screw-ups: Giving in to your *appetites* (desires) is worse than losing your *temper*. Think about it: the angry guy is fighting Reason, feeling pain, spasming internally. The guy chasing pleasure (appetite) is willingly seduced, acting more deliberately weak and kinda pathetic in his wrongdoing. So yeah, Theophrastus was right, philosophically speaking: doing wrong for pleasure deserves more blame than doing wrong out of reactive pain. One guy feels wronged and snaps; the other *starts* the problem, letting desire pull him into screwing up.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Facing Death \\\u0026 What\u0027s Truly Bad}\n    Act, speak, and think *always* as if you could check out any minute. Leaving humanity? No big deal if Gods exist – they wouldn\u0027t let real harm touch you. If they don\u0027t exist, or don\u0027t care? Then why bother living in a world without gods or providence? But listen: they *do* exist, they *do* care about us, and they put it entirely in *our* power to avoid *real* harm (i.e., becoming a bad person). As for everything else? If something external was *truly* bad, they\u0027d have made sure we could all avoid it. (And how can something that doesn\u0027t make *you* a worse person make your *life* worse?) The fundamental Nature of the Universe wouldn\u0027t overlook this stuff out of ignorance, or lack the power to fix it. It wouldn\u0027t make such a massive blunder as letting supposed \u0027goods\u0027 and \u0027ills\u0027 fall randomly on good and bad people alike. Stuff like death, life, fame, shame, pain, pleasure, wealth, poverty – these hit everyone, good or bad. They aren\u0027t inherently right or wrong. Therefore, they are neither truly good nor truly bad.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Seeing Things Clearly (Transience, Death)}\n    Notice how fast everything vanishes? Physical bodies disappear into the Universe, memories fade in Time. Think about sensory stuff – especially things that lure you with pleasure or scare you with pain, or get hyped up by vanity. How cheap, pathetic, dirty, breakable, and ultimately dead it all is. That\u0027s a job for your reasoning mind. Also, consider: what kind of people are these whose opinions grant \u0027honor\u0027? What *is* death? Look at it directly. Mentally strip away all the bullshit stories we attach to it. You\u0027ll see it\u0027s nothing but Nature doing its thing. If you fear Nature\u0027s work, you\u0027re just a child. And death isn\u0027t just Nature\u0027s work; it\u0027s part of its *well-being*. Also, think about how we mortals connect with the Divine/God – through what part of us? And when is that part of us in the right state for it?\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Focus Inward, Not Outward}\n    Nothing\u0027s more pathetic than the guy constantly running around, trying to figure out everything external, \u0027searching the bowels of the earth\u0027 (like Pindar said), guessing what neighbors think. Dude, chill. It\u0027s *enough* to stick with the Divinity *inside* you and serve it honestly. That service means keeping your inner self clean from emotional freak-outs, pointless distractions, and whining about what comes from Gods or other people. Respect what comes from the Gods (it\u0027s excellent). Love what comes from humans (we\u0027re kin). Pity them sometimes too, for their ignorance of good and evil – that ignorance is a worse handicap than being physically blind.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{The Only Time You Have is Now}\n    Even if you were gonna live 3,000 or 30,000 years, remember this: nobody loses any life other than the one they\u0027re living *right now*. Nobody lives any other life than the one they\u0027re losing *right now*. So, the longest life and the shortest life basically amount to the same thing in terms of loss. Why? Because the *present* moment is the same for everyone. What\u0027s passing is the same. So what you lose is just a tiny blip. You can\u0027t lose the past (it\u0027s gone) or the future (it ain\u0027t here yet). How can someone take what you don\u0027t have? So, two key takeaways: 1) Everything repeats eternally, like reruns. Doesn\u0027t matter if you watch the same show for 100 years, 200, or infinity. 2) The guy who lives longest and the guy who dies earliest lose exactly the same thing: the present moment. Because that\u0027s all anyone ever truly *has*, and you can\u0027t lose what you don\u0027t possess.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Perception is Reality (Mostly)}\n    \"Everything is what you judge it to be.\" That comeback to Monimus the Cynic is obvious, yeah. But the saying itself is useful, if you grab the core truth: Your *perception* shapes your experience.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{How Your Soul Screws Itself Over}\n    A person\u0027s soul messes itself up, most fundamentally, when:\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item It isolates itself, becoming like a tumor on the Universe. Fighting reality, rebelling against what happens – that\u0027s cutting yourself off from the Nature that connects everything.\n        \\item It turns against another person or pushes against them with the intent to harm (like when people get enraged).\n        \\item It lets itself be controlled by pleasure or pain.\n        \\item It acts fake, saying or doing things falsely or with pretense.\n        \\item It acts without a clear goal or conscious purpose, just flailing randomly. Even the smallest actions should aim towards the ultimate End. And the End for rational beings? To follow the rules and order of the most awesome City and Government (Reason, the Cosmos).\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Life\u0027s Breakdown \\\u0026 The Only Lifeline}\n    Quick rundown of human life: Time \u003d a blink. Existence \u003d a river flowing away. Senses \u003d unreliable, cloudy. Body \u003d constantly decaying junk. Spirit \u003d a chaotic swirl. Fortune \u003d unpredictable. Fame \u003d quickly forgotten. Sum up: Body stuff is like a river, gone. Mind stuff is like a dream, hazy. Life itself is a battle, a brief stay in a foreign land. Afterlife fame? Oblivion. So what the hell can guide us through? One thing and one thing only: Philosophy. Real philosophy means: keeping your inner spirit unharmed and untouched, master of pains and pleasures, doing nothing randomly, nothing fake; not needing others to do (or not do) things for your well-being; accepting what happens (your assigned lot) as coming from the same Source you came from. And through it all, calmly waiting for death, seeing it as just a release of the elements that make up every living thing. If the elements themselves aren\u0027t harmed by constantly changing into each other, why should *you* freak out about the change and breakdown of *your* elements? It\u0027s natural. And nothing natural is truly evil.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\newpage % Start Book 3 on a new page\n\n\\section*{Book III}\n(\\textit{Scribbled down in Carnuntum, wherever the hell that is. Probably deployed.})\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Your Brain Might Go First - Hurry Up!}\n    Okay, listen up. It\u0027s not just that life is burning down day by day, leaving less in the tank. You also gotta consider this: even if you *do* live longer, there\u0027s no guarantee your mind will stay sharp enough to actually *understand* shit – the deep stuff about life, the universe, everything. Your body might keep chugging along (breathing, eating, feeling basic urges), but the stuff that *matters* – using yourself correctly, making precise judgments about duty, analyzing what your senses are *really* telling you, knowing if it\u0027s time to gracefully exit, all that complex decision-making – that stuff starts fading *before* the body quits. So, get moving! Not just \u0027cause death is closer, but because your ability to process life and adapt properly might already be on the decline.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Find the Cool in the Cracks}\n    Pay attention to the details, man. Even the side effects of natural processes have their own kind of rugged beauty. Like when bread bakes and cracks open? Those cracks technically mess up the baker\u0027s perfect plan, but they *look* cool, make you want to eat it more. Figs splitting open when ripe, olives getting that slightly \u0027overripe\u0027 look that\u0027s actually perfect. Corn stalks bending low, a lion\u0027s furrowed brow, foam on a boar\u0027s mouth – lots of stuff isn\u0027t \u0027pretty\u0027 up close, but because it\u0027s part of how Nature works, it adds character, a certain badass appeal. If you really *feel* and *understand* how the Universe operates, almost everything, even the small background details, will seem kinda awesome in its own way. You\u0027ll dig the real jaws of a wild animal as much as some artist\u0027s statue. You\u0027ll see a kind of vibrancy even in old age. You\u0027ll look at the people who work for you with clear, objective eyes. Lots of moments like this happen, not for everyone, but for the guy who\u0027s genuinely gotten in tune with Nature and its works.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Everyone Punches Out}\n    Hippocrates cured tons of people, then got sick and died himself. Astrologers predicted futures, then their own clocks ran out. Alexander, Pompey, Caesar – leveled cities, killed countless soldiers – they eventually bit the dust too. Heraclitus talked fire and brimstone cosmology, then bloated up with fluid, covered himself in cow shit (weird!), and died. Lice got Democritus; different kind of parasite (bad people) got Socrates. The point? You got on the boat (born), you sailed (lived), you reached the port (dying). Time to disembark. If there\u0027s another life? Cool, gods are everywhere, even there. If it\u0027s just lights out (unconsciousness)? Then you stop feeling pain and pleasure, stop being a slave to this meat-sack vessel which is way inferior to the thing *using* it (your mind, your inner divinity). One is Mind and God-spark, the other is just clay and blood.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Mind Your OWN Business (Seriously)}\n    Stop wasting the rest of your life obsessing about other people, *unless* it directly contributes to the common good. Why rob yourself of time you could use for your *own* growth? All that energy spent wondering \"What\u0027s he doing? Why\u0027d she say that? What are they thinking/planning?\" – it just pulls you away from keeping watch over your *own* governing self (your Reason). Cut out the random, pointless thoughts. Especially ditch the nosiness and negativity. Train yourself so if someone suddenly asked, \"Whatcha thinkin\u0027 about right now?\" you could answer instantly and honestly, \"Just this simple, kind thought,\" revealing you\u0027re a decent, social being, not hung up on selfish pleasures, petty rivalries, envy, suspicion, or anything else you\u0027d be embarrassed to admit was rattling around in your head. A guy like that, who stops delaying and steps up to be truly excellent? He\u0027s like a priest, serving the gods, using that inner core correctly. He keeps himself untainted by chasing pleasure, untouched by pain, unharmed by wrongs, unaware of petty wickedness. He\u0027s a wrestler in the ultimate match – refusing to be thrown by passion. Soaked in justice, welcoming *everything* that happens and is assigned to him. Rarely thinks about others\u0027 business, and only when absolutely necessary for the collective good. He\u0027s focused on *his* work, *his* contribution, constantly mindful of his assigned role in the Whole. He perfects his part, trusts his lot is good. Because that inner spirit (daemon) assigned to you? It guides you, carries you. Plus, remember all rational beings are related. Caring for all humans fits our nature. But cling to the opinions only of those living *in accord with Nature*. As for the others? Keep in mind what they\u0027re *really* like – at home, out and about, day and night, the crap company they keep. Don\u0027t waste energy on praise from people who don\u0027t even like *themselves*.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Stand Up Straight (Metaphorically)}\n    Don\u0027t act grudgingly. Don\u0027t act selfishly. Don\u0027t act without thinking it through. Don\u0027t have conflicting motives. Don\u0027t let fancy words or appearances cover up sloppy thinking. Don\u0027t be a motormouth or a busybody meddler. Let the God *within you* be the guardian of a *real man* – mature, civic-minded, Roman, a leader who\u0027s taken his post like a soldier waiting for the signal to withdraw, ready to go, needing no external validation or witness. Have a cheerful face. Don\u0027t *need* help from outside or rely on others for your peace. You should stand upright *on your own*, not be propped up by others.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Find the Best? Grab It. (Spoiler: It\u0027s Inside)}\n    If you find anything in life better than justice, truth, self-control, courage – better, basically, than your own Reason being satisfied with itself when it guides you to act rightly and accept fate calmly – if you see something *higher* than that? Turn to it with everything you\u0027ve got and enjoy that supreme good. BUT, if nothing shows up that\u0027s better than that divine spark *already seated within you*, the one that keeps your impulses in check, examines your thoughts, detaches from knee-jerk reactions (like Socrates said), aligns itself with the gods, and prioritizes caring for others... if you find everything else is smaller and cheaper than *this*? Then give no room to anything else. Because once you lean towards those other things (popularity, power, wealth, pleasure), you lose the ability to consistently honor what is uniquely *yours*, your own true good. It\u0027s just wrong to set up rivals (like fame or fortune) against the good of Reason and the Community. Those other things might seem okay for a bit, but they quickly take over and drag you off course. So, I\u0027m telling you: simply, freely, choose the higher path and *stick to it*. \"But higher means advantageous!\" Yeah, if it\u0027s advantageous to your *rational* self, lock onto it. If it only benefits your animal side, fine, admit it, but stick to your decision without making a big show. Just be damn sure you make a choice that won\u0027t screw you over later.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Integrity Over Everything}\n    Never, ever value something as \u0027advantageous\u0027 if it forces you to break your word, lose self-respect, hate someone, be suspicious, curse others, fake it, or desire things that need secrets and cover-ups. The man who prioritizes his own Mind and inner Divinity, and the sacred practice of its excellence? He doesn\u0027t make a scene. He doesn\u0027t whine. He doesn\u0027t *need* to hide away in solitude *or* be constantly surrounded by crowds. Most importantly, he lives without desperately chasing things *or* desperately avoiding them. He doesn\u0027t give a damn whether he gets a longer or shorter time using this soul-in-a-body setup. Even if he has to check out *right now*, he\u0027ll go as smoothly and decently as he\u0027d do any other task, focused his whole life on just one thing: keeping his understanding aligned with what it means to be a rational, social being.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Clean Inside, No Need to Hide}\n    Look inside the mind of a disciplined and purified person. You won\u0027t find any festering wounds, no rot, no hidden infections under the surface. Fate doesn\u0027t catch his life unfinished, like an actor leaving the stage mid-play. There\u0027s nothing slave-like or fake about him. He\u0027s not dependent on others, nor cut off from them. Nothing to make excuses for, nothing that needs a dark corner to hide in.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Respect Your Judgment}\n    Revere your power of judgment. Everything depends on it – keeping your governing self aligned with Nature and the needs of a rational being. Good judgment promises deliberation, genuine connection with others, and walking in step with the gods/Universe.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Life\u0027s Tiny, Fame\u0027s Tinier}\n    So, throw everything else away and hold onto just these few core ideas. And remember: you only live *right now*, this tiny moment. The rest is either already lived or totally uncertain. Tiny life, tiny corner of the earth you live on, even the longest-lasting fame is tiny and depends on a chain of flawed mortals who\u0027ll be dead soon anyway and don\u0027t even know themselves, let alone some dude who died ages ago.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Break It Down: Analyze Everything}\n    Add this tool to your kit: Always make a mental sketch or outline of whatever impression hits you. See its core essence, naked, whole and in parts. Name it specifically, name its components, name what it will eventually break down into. Nothing builds mental greatness like the power to systematically and truthfully test *everything* you encounter. Always look at it thinking: What purpose does this serve in *this* kind of Universe? What\u0027s its value to the Whole? What\u0027s its value to *me*, a citizen of the highest City (the Cosmos), where all other cities are just households? What *is* this thing making an impression on me right now? What\u0027s it made of? How long will it naturally last? What virtue do I need to deal with it (kindness, courage, honesty, simplicity, self-reliance, etc.)? Therefore, for everything, say: \"This came from God/Fate.\" Or: \"This came from the interconnectedness of events, the cosmic web, coincidence.\" Or: \"This came from my fellow human, my kin, my comrade, who just doesn\u0027t know what\u0027s truly natural for him.\" But *I* do know. So I treat him kindly and justly, according to the natural law of fellowship. While still aiming for what\u0027s truly deserved, especially in matters that are morally neutral.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{The Simple Path to a Good Life}\n    If you tackle the task at hand right now, following Reason – seriously, powerfully, kindly – and don\u0027t get sidetracked, but keep your inner divinity pure and strong, like you might have to give it back this very second... If you lock this down, expecting nothing, avoiding nothing, just content with *present action* aligned with Nature and heroic truth in what you say and mean... you *will* live a blessed life. And nobody can stop you from doing this.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Keep Your Principles Ready}\n    Just like doctors always have their tools ready for emergencies, you need your core principles (doctrines) always ready. Use them to understand the divine and human connection, and then do *everything*, even the smallest stuff, remembering that link. You won\u0027t do human stuff well without relating it to the divine perspective, and vice versa.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Stop Preparing, Start Living}\n    Quit wandering off track! You\u0027re not gonna get around to rereading all those notebooks, those histories of Rome and Greece, those quotes you saved up for \u0027old age\u0027. Get to the damn goal! Drop the wishful thinking. Help *yourself*, right now, if you care about yourself at all, while you still can.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Seeing Beyond the Surface}\n    Some people don\u0027t grasp the real meaning behind things like \u0027theft\u0027, \u0027sowing\u0027, \u0027buying\u0027, \u0027resting\u0027, \u0027seeing what needs doing\u0027. True understanding isn\u0027t just about physical eyesight; it requires a different kind of vision – insight into the principles.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{The Mark of the Truly Good Man}\n    A person shouldn\u0027t treasure any of those things that don\u0027t belong to a human being *as a human being*. They aren\u0027t requirements of our nature, our nature doesn\u0027t promise them, and they aren\u0027t completions or perfections of human nature. Therefore, our ultimate purpose (end/telos) doesn\u0027t lie in them, and certainly not the \u0027good\u0027 that fulfills that purpose. Besides, if any of those external things (wealth, fame, etc.) were truly part of our essential portion, it wouldn\u0027t make sense for us to disdain them or resist them. The person who achieves independence from them wouldn\u0027t be praiseworthy, and the person who deliberately takes less wouldn\u0027t be considered good, if they were *really* \u0027Goods\u0027. But as things actually are, the more a man strips himself of these things, or bears it patiently when they\u0027re taken from him, the *better* a person he is.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\newpage % Start Book 4 on a new page\n\n\\section*{Book IV}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Your Inner Boss is Adaptable Like Fire}\n    The command center inside you, your core Reason? In its natural state, it faces whatever happens by instantly adapting to what\u0027s actually possible and presented. It doesn\u0027t get obsessed with one specific outcome or material. Instead, it approaches goals with a crucial \u0027plan B\u0027 mentality (*with a reservation*). Then, whatever obstacle gets in the way? It turns *that* into fuel for itself. Think of fire: a tiny candle gets snuffed out by a pile of stuff, but a roaring blaze takes whatever you throw on it, consumes it, and leaps *even higher* because of those very obstacles. Your Reason can do that too.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Act With Purpose, Live With Skill}\n    Don\u0027t launch into anything without a clear purpose. And don\u0027t do it any other way than according to the core principles that perfect the art of living. No random shit, only deliberate, skilled action.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{The Ultimate Retreat is Internal}\n    People hunt for quiet spots – cabins, beaches, mountains. You feel that same urge sometimes, wanting to get away. Totally normal. But it\u0027s kinda rookie-level thinking for a philosopher, because you can retreat *anytime you want* just by going inside your own head. Seriously, nowhere is quieter or more private than your own mind. Especially if you\u0027ve stocked it with solid principles. Just look inward, and bam – instant ease. And by \u0027ease,\u0027 I mean *good inner order*, being well-behaved internally. So, keep giving yourself this mental retreat. Make it a regular thing to repair and reset yourself. Keep it quick: focus on brief, fundamental truths. They\u0027ll be enough to wash away the stress and send you back to deal with life without resentment.\n    What\u0027s making you resentful? Other people\u0027s bullshit? Remember the core judgment: we rational creatures exist for each other. Patience is a part of justice. People screw up unintentionally (out of ignorance). And think how many people – after all the drama, suspicion, hatred, and fighting – ended up laid out dead and turned to dust. That should give you pause. Okay, maybe it\u0027s your assigned \u0027lot\u0027 in life that\u0027s bugging you? Refresh the basic options: either there\u0027s a guiding Plan (Providence) or it\u0027s all just random atoms colliding (and even then, patterns emerge). Remember all the evidence suggesting the Universe is like one big, interconnected community (Commonwealth). Still letting physical stuff get to you? Remind yourself that your understanding (mind), once it gets its act together and knows its own power, doesn\u0027t get tangled up in the body\u0027s ups and downs, whether things feel smooth or rough. And finally, recall everything you\u0027ve heard and agreed to about handling pain and pleasure rationally.\n    Alright, what about chasing fame and glory? Is *that* distracting you? Look at how fast *everyone* is forgotten. Think about the infinite abyss of time stretching behind you and before you. Consider how hollow applause is, how fickle and clueless most \u0027praisers\u0027 are, and how tiny the stage (your circle, your world) really is. This should make you stop and think. The whole Earth is just a speck. Your home? A tiny corner of that speck. The people who might praise you there? So few, and frankly, pretty insignificant in the grand scheme.\n    So, final point: remember to retreat into this \u0027little domain\u0027 – *yourself*. Most importantly: don\u0027t get stressed out or feel tortured by external stuff. Be free. Look at things like a man, a human being, a citizen, a mortal creature. And out of all the truths ready at hand, keep these two front and center: \\textbf{One:} External things don\u0027t actually *touch* your mind; they just stand there, outside, unmoved. Disturbances come only from the *judgment* you make inside. \\textbf{Two:} Everything you see is changing right now and will soon cease to exist. Constantly think about how many changes you\u0027ve already witnessed.\n    The Universe *is* change; life *is* your perception and judgment (opinion).\n\n    \\item \\textbf{We\u0027re All Connected by Reason}\n    If Mind (the capacity for reason) is common to all of us, then the Reason *by which* we are rational beings is also common. If that\u0027s true, then the Reason that tells us what to do and what not to do is also common. If *that\u0027s* true, then the fundamental Law is common. If that\u0027s true, we are all citizens. If that\u0027s true, we share in one single system or constitution. If *that\u0027s* true, the Universe is basically one big Commonwealth or City. Because what other shared government could possibly include the entire human race? And it\u0027s from this Common City – the Cosmos – that we get our very mind, our reason, and our sense of law. Where else? Just like the earthy part of me comes from *some* earth, the watery part from *some* water, the air/spirit part from *some* source, and the fiery/hot part from *its* own source (because nothing comes from nothing, and nothing vanishes into nothing), so too the Mind must come from *some* universal Source.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Death \u003d Birth \u003d Natural Mystery}\n    Death is basically like birth – just another one of Nature\u0027s mysteries. It\u0027s elements combining (birth) and then dissolving back into the same elements (death). Generally speaking, there\u0027s nothing shameful about this. It doesn\u0027t contradict being a rational creature or the fundamental principles of our design.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Expect Figs to Have Juice (Expect People to Be People)}\n    Certain outcomes are the natural and necessary result of certain kinds of beings. Someone acting like an asshole? That\u0027s what assholes *do*. Wishing it wasn\u0027t so is like wishing a fig tree didn\u0027t produce its sharp juice. It\u0027s pointless. Just accept the nature of things. And always remember this: in a very short time, both you and that person will be dead. And a little while after that, nobody will even remember either of your names.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Drop the Judgment, Drop the Hurt}\n    Get rid of the judgment, \"I have been harmed.\" Once you do that, you get rid of the *feeling* of having been harmed. Get rid of the feeling, and you get rid of the harm itself. It lives in your judgment.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{What Doesn\u0027t Make You Worse, Doesn\u0027t Harm You}\n    Whatever doesn\u0027t make *you* a worse person (less just, temperate, courageous, wise) cannot make your *life* worse, and it doesn\u0027t truly harm you, externally or internally.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Nature\u0027s Benefit is Necessary}\n    It\u0027s a law of necessity that what is naturally beneficial *had* to happen this way for the good of the whole system.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Everything Happens Justly (If You Look Right)}\n    \"All that comes to pass, comes to pass with justice.\" If you watch carefully, you\u0027ll find this is true. I don\u0027t just mean \u0027in the right sequence,\u0027 but according to fundamental fairness, as if distributed by someone assigning things based on true worth or cosmic balance. So, keep observing as you\u0027ve begun, and whatever you do, do it with this in mind: act with *goodness*, the specific kind of goodness that defines a truly good person. Preserve this quality in everything.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{See Reality, Not Their Spin}\n    Don\u0027t look at things the way the person doing wrong sees them, or the way they *want* you to see them. See things as they *actually are*, in truth.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Two Prep Steps: Act Right, Be Correctable}\n    Always be ready in these two ways: \\textbf{First}, only act as Reason (your inner king and lawgiver) dictates, specifically for the benefit of mankind. \\textbf{Second}, be ready to change your course *if* someone corrects you and guides you away from a mistaken notion. But—and this is key—that correction must come from a conviction of *justice* or the *common good*. Don\u0027t change your mind just because the alternative seems pleasant or popular.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Got Reason? Use It!}\n    \"You possess Reason?\" \"Yes, I do!\" \"Then why the hell aren\u0027t you using it? If this faculty is doing its job, what else could you possibly need?\"\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Part of the Whole, Back to the Source}\n    You came into existence as a part of the Whole. You will eventually vanish back into that which gave you birth. Or rather, you\u0027ll be taken up and transformed back into its creative, generative Reason through the process of change.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Incense on the Altar}\n    Imagine many grains of incense tossed onto the same altar. One falls and burns up first, another falls later. Is there any real difference between them? Nope. Same with life and death.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Ten Days to Godhood (Metaphorically)}\n    Stick to your core principles and maintain reverence for Reason (the Logos/Word) consistently. Within ten days, even those people who currently see you as a brute or a fool might start looking at you like you\u0027re some kind of god. Transformation happens when you get serious and stay consistent.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Live NOW, Not Later}\n    Stop acting like you\u0027re going to live for ten thousand years. Fate hangs over your head. While you\u0027re alive, while you still *can*, become a good person. Do it now.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Inner Focus Brings Peace}\n    Think how much hassle and mental energy you save when you stop obsessing over what your neighbor says, does, or thinks, and focus *only* on what *you yourself* are doing. Make sure your own actions are just and holy, aligned with the conduct of a good person. Don\u0027t get distracted looking at \"black characters\" (bad examples). Run straight toward the finish line, stay balanced, don\u0027t flail about.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{The Joke of Posthumous Fame}\n    The guy freaking out about his reputation after death fails to realize that every single person who remembers him will *also* die very soon. Then the person who remembers *them* will die, and so on, until the entire memory is extinguished like a line of candles blowing out one by one. Okay, let\u0027s pretend the rememberers *and* the memory somehow last forever. So what? What does that have to do with *you* now? And I\u0027m not just saying it\u0027s useless to the dead; what good is praise even to the *living*, except maybe for some practical advantage (like networking or getting a promotion)? By chasing fame, you\u0027re foolishly neglecting the *real* gift of Nature right now – your own inner worth – which doesn\u0027t depend on anyone else\u0027s testimony.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{True Beauty Needs No Praise}\n    Anything that is truly beautiful or excellent is so *in itself*. It finds its completion in itself. Praise is not part of its essence. Whatever gets praised doesn\u0027t become better or worse because of it. This applies to things commonly called beautiful too, like materials or works of art. What does something *truly* beautiful lack? Nothing. It\u0027s complete. Same goes for Law, Truth, Kindness, or Self-Respect. Is any of these beautiful *because* it\u0027s praised, or ruined *because* it\u0027s blamed? Does an emerald become less valuable if nobody compliments it? What about gold, ivory, purple dye, a lyre, a sword blade, a flower bud, a small plant? Their quality is inherent.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Cosmic Recycling (Souls \\\u0026 Matter)}\n    Someone asks: \"If souls persist, how does the atmosphere hold them all eternally?\" Counter: \"How does the earth hold all the bodies buried over ages?\" Just as change and dissolution make room for new bodies on earth, maybe souls in the air also change, dissolve, get poured out, and reignited—absorbed back into the Universe\u0027s generative principle (creative energy)—making room for the next batch. That\u0027s one possible answer, *if* souls persist. But consider not just buried bodies, but all the animals eaten daily by us and other creatures! A huge number get consumed, effectively \u0027buried\u0027 in the eaters\u0027 bodies. Yet there\u0027s room because they transform into blood, air, heat. How do we investigate this? By distinguishing between the material aspect and the causal principle (the \u0027what\u0027 and the \u0027why/how\u0027).\n\n    \\item \\textbf{No Aimless Wandering (Mental or Physical)}\n    Don\u0027t drift without purpose. In every impulse to act, ensure it aligns with justice. In every thought and imagination, maintain clear understanding and accurate perception.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Alignment with the Universe}\n    Everything that is fitting for you, my Universe, is fitting for me. Nothing that happens in your good timing is too early or too late for me. Everything your seasons bear, Nature, is fruit for me. All things come from you, exist in you, return to you. The poet might sing, \"Dear city of Cecrops (Athens)!\" Will you not say, with even more feeling, \"Dear city of God (the Cosmos)!\"?\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Do Less, But Do What Matters}\n    Democritus advised: \"Do few things, if you want peace.\" Maybe it\u0027s even better: Do the *necessary* things, the things that the Reason of a naturally social creature dictates, and do them *as* Reason dictates. This brings peace not only from doing things *right*, but also from doing *fewer* things. If you cut out most of the unnecessary stuff we say and do, you\u0027ll have more leisure and fewer interruptions. So, on every occasion, ask yourself: \"Is this *really* necessary?\" And remove not just unnecessary actions, but unnecessary *imaginations* too, because pointless thoughts lead to pointless actions down the line.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Test Drive the Good Life}\n    Try it out yourself: See how well the life of the good man actually works. The man who is pleased with what the Universe assigns him and is content with his own just actions and kind disposition. See how that feels.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Quick Summary: Keep It Simple}\n    You\u0027ve seen all that external stuff. Now focus on this internal stuff: Don\u0027t trouble yourself. Make yourself simple. Someone does wrong? They do wrong *to themselves*. Something happens *to* you? It\u0027s fine; it was all woven into your destiny by Universal Nature from the beginning. The bottom line is this: life is short. Use the present moment profitably, with reason and justice. Be sober (clear-headed) without making it a huge struggle.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Order In You, Order In the Whole}\n    Is it an ordered Universe (Cosmos) or just a chaotic jumble thrown together – which, even then, still has *some* kind of order? Or, is it possible that there can be order *within you* but disorder in the *Whole*? Especially when everything is so clearly distinct, yet also interconnected and interacting sympathetically? Doesn\u0027t compute. There\u0027s an underlying order.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Profile of a Bad Character}\n    A \"black character\" (a corrupt heart/mind) is weak, stubborn; like a beast of prey, a brute, or a spoiled child; it\u0027s foolish, sneaky, vulgar, greedy, tyrannical.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Who\u0027s Lost in the Universe?}\n    If someone doesn\u0027t recognize the fundamental nature of the Universe, they\u0027re a foreigner in it. No less a foreigner is the person who doesn\u0027t recognize what *happens* in it (the natural processes). A fugitive is someone who runs away from the rational law of our shared City (the Cosmos). A blind man is someone who closes the eye of his mind. A beggar is someone who always needs something from others and lacks self-sufficiency for life\u0027s essentials. A tumor on the Universe is someone who rebels and cuts himself off from the reason of our common nature just because he\u0027s unhappy with events (remember: the Nature that produced you also produced these events). A fragment cut off from the City is someone who severs his own soul from the single soul of all rational beings.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Hypocrisy Check}\n    Here\u0027s a philosopher without a proper tunic, another without books, another practically naked. One says, \"I have no bread, but I still stand firm by Reason (the Word/Logos).\" And *I* have all this nourishment from my learning, yet *I* don\u0027t always stand firm. Ouch. Self-check needed.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Love Your Craft, Trust the Gods}\n    Love the art, the skill, the role you were taught. Set up your resting place right there. Go through the rest of your life as someone who has committed everything that is truly yours (your choices, your will) with your whole heart to the gods/Universe, and in your dealings with people, make yourself neither a tyrant over them nor a slave to any of them.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{History Repeats: Focus on Your Role Now}\n    Think back, for example, to the time of Emperor Vespasian. You\u0027ll see the exact same things happening: people marrying, raising kids, getting sick, dying, fighting, feasting, trading, farming, flattering, being arrogant, suspecting others, plotting, praying for someone else\u0027s death, complaining about the present, being horny, hoarding wealth, desperately wanting promotions and power. Now... where is that life of theirs? Gone. Completely vanished. Okay, move on to Emperor Trajan\u0027s time. Again, exactly the same patterns. That life? Also dead. Do this exercise with other historical periods and entire nations. See how many people struggled intensely, then quickly fell and dissolved back into the elements. But most importantly, review the people *you personally knew* who got distracted by pointless vanity, neglecting to do what matched their own constitution (their nature and role), failing to just hold fast to *that* and be content with *that*. And here\u0027s a key point: remember that the attention you give to each action has its own proper value and proportion. Only by understanding this will you avoid feeling dejected if you\u0027re occupied with smaller matters, as long as you\u0027re giving them no more attention than is appropriate.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Fame is Fleeting, Virtue Endures}\n    Words that were common back then sound archaic now. Same for the names of heroes once praised to the skies – Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Dentatus; a bit later, Scipio and Cato; then Augustus; then Hadrian and Antoninus. They\u0027re becoming historical artifacts. Why? Because all things fade quickly, turn into myths, and then get buried completely by oblivion. And I\u0027m talking about the ones who shone like superstars! The rest? As soon as they breathed their last, they were \"unnoticed and unwept.\" And what, after all, is \"everlasting remembrance\"? Utter vanity. So, what *should* a person genuinely focus their efforts on? This one thing: right understanding, treating others decently (neighborly behavior), speech that is never false, and a disposition that welcomes everything that happens as necessary, as familiar, as flowing from the same source and fountain as oneself.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Surrender to Your Fate}\n    With your whole will, surrender yourself to Clotho (Fate). Let her spin your destiny into whatever web of events she chooses. Accept it fully.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Rememberer and Remembered Both Vanish}\n    Everything is ephemeral, lasting only a moment: both the one who remembers and the one who is remembered.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Nature Loves Change: Everything is Seed}\n    Continuously contemplate how *all things* come into being through change. Train yourself to think that Universal Nature loves nothing more than to change the things that exist and create new things similar to them. For everything that *is* now is, in a way, the seed of whatever will emerge from it. You probably think \u0027seeds\u0027 are just the things you put in the earth or a womb. But that\u0027s a very unscientific, limited view. Change itself is the seed process.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Still Not Ready? Get Simple.}\n    You\u0027re going to be dead very soon, and yet you are still not: simple, untroubled, free from the suspicion that external things can hurt you, genuinely well-disposed towards all people, nor yet convinced that wisdom consists *only* in acting justly.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Even the \"Wise\" Chase Trivia}\n    Look closely at the guiding principles even of people considered wise. See what petty things they avoid and what trivial things they pursue!\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Your Evil is Your Judgment, Not Events}\n    Your \u0027evil\u0027 or \u0027harm\u0027 doesn\u0027t exist in someone else\u0027s controlling mind (governing principle), nor in any change or alteration of your environment. Where is it then? It\u0027s in the part of *you* which *forms judgments* about evil. Let that part stop making the judgment, and all is well. Even if what\u0027s closest to it – your physical body – is cut, burned, festering, or dying, let the part that *judges* these things remain at peace. That is, let it decide that nothing is truly good or evil if it can happen indifferently to both the evil man and the good man. Because whatever happens equally to someone living contrary to Nature and someone living according to Nature, that thing itself must be neutral – neither according to Nature nor contrary to it.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{The Universe as One Organism}\n    Constantly think of the Universe as one single living creature, containing one substance and one soul. Consider how all things are absorbed into this single perception; how it does everything with a single impulse; how all things are co-causes of everything that happens; and the intricate, wonderful web and interconnectedness of it all.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Soul Carrying a Corpse}\n    You are a little soul carrying a corpse around, as Epictetus used to put it. (A stark reminder of the mind/body distinction).\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Change Itself Isn\u0027t Evil or Good}\n    In the natural process of change, nothing that happens is inherently evil, just as nothing that comes *into existence* as a result of change is inherently good. It\u0027s all just transformation.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Time as a Raging River}\n    There\u0027s a constant flow of things coming into being, like a river, and Time is a violent torrent. No sooner is something seen than it\u0027s swept away, and another thing is carried past, and that too will soon be gone.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{The Familiarity of Life\u0027s Events}\n    Everything that happens is as familiar and predictable as roses in spring and grapes in summer. Things like sickness, death, slander, plotting, and everything that makes foolish people either ecstatic or miserable – these are all just standard, recurring patterns.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Organic Connection, Not Random List}\n    What follows in time is always organically related to what came before. It\u0027s not like a random list of unrelated items simply determined by necessity. It\u0027s a rational combination. Just as Being (existence itself) is arranged in a mutually coordinated way, so too the phenomena of Becoming (things happening) display not just bare succession, but a wonderful, organic interconnectedness.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Heraclitus\u0027s Wisdom: Change, Logos, Wake Up!}\n    Always remember what Heraclitus taught: \"The death of earth gives birth to water, the death of water gives birth to air, the death of air gives birth to fire, and back again.\" Remember his image of the man who forgets which way he\u0027s going. And how \"people are constantly at odds with the very thing they interact with most continuously (the Logos, the Reason that governs the Universe),\" and how \"the things they encounter every day seem alien to them.\" And again: \"We must not act and speak like people who are asleep\" (because even in sleep, we think we\u0027re acting and speaking). And \"we must not be like children blindly accepting things from their parents,\" that is, accepting things simply as we\u0027ve received them without critical examination.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Tomorrow vs. Eternity: Tiny Difference}\n    Just as, if one of the gods told you, \"You will die tomorrow, or for sure the day after,\" you wouldn\u0027t make a huge fuss about that extra day unless you were a complete coward (because the difference is trivial). In the same way, count it as no great matter whether you live until some infinitely distant year versus just until tomorrow. Perspective matters.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Everyone Dies: Doctors, Stars, Cities. Live Right.}\n    Think constantly: how many physicians have died after all their worried frowning over patients? How many astrologers, after making grand predictions about other people\u0027s deaths? How many philosophers, after endless debates on death or immortality? How many great warriors, after slaughtering thousands? How many tyrants, after abusing their power over life and death with monstrous arrogance, acting as if they themselves were immortal? How many *entire cities* have effectively died: Helice, Pompeii, Herculaneum, countless others? Run over the list, too, of people *you* know, one after another. One person attended a funeral, and then was himself laid out for burial; another followed him. All in a short time. Here’s the whole point: Always see how ephemeral and cheap human affairs are – yesterday just a bit of mucus, tomorrow ashes or a mummy. Therefore, make your passage through this short span of time in obedience to Nature, and lay down your life gladly, like a ripe olive falling from the tree, blessing the Nature that produced it and grateful to the tree that gave it life.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Misfortune vs. Good Fortune: It\u0027s How You Bear It}\n    Be like a rocky headland against which the waves crash relentlessly. It stands firm, and the swirling waters calm down around it. Don\u0027t say, \"How unlucky I am that this happened to me!\" No, say instead: \"How *lucky* I am that, even though this happened, I continue free from sorrow, neither crushed by the present nor afraid of the future!\" Because look, something like this could have happened to anyone, but not everyone could have endured it without breaking down in sorrow. So why is the event itself more \u0027misfortune\u0027 than your resilience is \u0027good fortune\u0027? Do you generally call something a person\u0027s \u0027misfortune\u0027 if it doesn\u0027t contradict human nature? And do you think something contradicts human nature if it\u0027s not opposed to the will of that nature (i.e., Reason)? Okay, you know what that rational will is. Can this thing that happened possibly prevent you from being just, high-minded, temperate, prudent, deliberate, trustworthy, self-respecting, free, or possessing any of the other qualities which, when present, allow a person\u0027s nature to achieve its full potential? So, finally, in every situation that tempts you toward sorrow, remember to use this principle: *This event is not a misfortune, but to bear it bravely is good fortune.*\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Clinging to Life is Pointless}\n    Here\u0027s a rough-and-ready (unscientific, maybe, but helpful) support for overcoming the fear of death: Review the cases of people who clung desperately to life. What *more* did they really gain than those who died earlier? They all ended up buried eventually: Caedicianus, Fabius, Julianus, Lepidus, and all the others like them, who carried many people to their graves and then were carried out themselves. Generally speaking, the difference in lifespan is small, and this small difference is often bought through great struggles, dealing with difficult people, and living in a frail body. So don\u0027t count that extra time as some great prize. Look at the abyss of time behind you and the infinite time stretching ahead. In that vastness, what\u0027s the real difference between an infant who lives three days and a legendary old man like Nestor who lived for three generations? Practically nothing.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Nature\u0027s Road is Short and Straight}\n    Always run the short road – and Nature\u0027s road *is* the short road. Therefore, say and do everything in the most sound, rational way. Sticking to this kind of purpose delivers you from troubles, conflicts, from every unnecessary care and excessive bullshit.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\newpage % Start Book 5 on a new page\n\n\\section*{Book V}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Get Out of Bed, Do Your Job}\n    Crack of dawn, alarm goes off (or someone calls you), and you really don\u0027t want to get up? Have this thought ready: \"I\u0027m being called to do *human* work. Why am I bitching about going to do the very thing I was born for, the reason I was put on this earth? Was I made just to snuggle under the covers and stay warm?\" \"Yeah, but this feels nicer!\" \"Seriously? Were you born for *pleasure*? For *feeling* good, instead of *acting*? Look at the plants, birds, ants, spiders, bees – they\u0027re all busting their asses, doing their specific jobs, contributing to the order of the world. And *you\u0027re* refusing to do the work of a human being? You won\u0027t jump up and do what your own nature demands?\" \"Okay, okay, but people need rest too!\" Fine, I agree. But Nature sets limits on rest, just like on eating and drinking. And *you* constantly go *beyond* those limits, past what\u0027s enough. Except when it comes to *actions* – there, you stay *inside* your potential, doing less than you could. Why? Because you don\u0027t truly love yourself. If you did, you\u0027d love your nature and its purpose. Look at other guys who love their crafts – they wear themselves out working, skipping meals, not showering. But you honor your *own* nature *less* than the blacksmith honors his metal, the dancer his moves, the greedy dude his cash, the attention whore his fame. When *they\u0027re* passionate, they blow off food and sleep to advance their goals. But *you* think acts of teamwork and contributing to society are less valuable and deserve less effort? Weak.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Wipe the Slate Clean}\n    How easy is it to just reject and erase every distracting or messed-up thought, and instantly achieve perfect calm? Super easy. Do it.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Own Your Actions, Ignore the Haters}\n    Convince yourself you *deserve* every word and action that aligns with Nature (Reason). Don\u0027t let anyone\u0027s blame or gossip talk you out of it. If it\u0027s the right thing to do or say, don\u0027t second-guess yourself or feel unworthy. Those other people have their own internal drivers, their own agendas. Don\u0027t get sidetracked looking at them. Just walk your straight path, following your own Nature and the common Nature (of the Universe) – because ultimately, their path is one and the same.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Walking Nature\u0027s Path Back Home}\n    I walk the path Nature sets out until I lie down and rest. My last breath will go back into the air I draw from daily. I\u0027ll lie down on the earth from which my father got his seed, my mother her blood, my nurse her milk. The same earth that\u0027s fed and watered me day after day for years, that supports my footsteps and puts up with me using it for countless purposes (some probably not great).\n\n    \\item \\textbf{You Have Power, Use It - No Excuses}\n    \"Okay, fine, maybe my raw intelligence isn\u0027t super impressive.\" Granted! But there\u0027s a shit-ton of other qualities you *can\u0027t* say you weren\u0027t gifted with. So, bring forth what is *totally* in your power: honesty, dignity, endurance, resisting cheap pleasures, being content with your lot, needing little, kindness, freedom, simplicity, being reserved in speech (not gossiping), magnanimity (big-heartedness). Don\u0027t you see how much you *can* offer, where there\u0027s zero excuse about lacking talent or ability? And yet, you\u0027re still content playing in the minor leagues? Are you forced to complain, be greedy, flatter people, blame your body for your failings, suck up, brag, be mentally scattered *because* you weren\u0027t born a genius? Hell no! By the gods, you could have ditched all that crap long ago. The only possible valid excuse might be some slowness in understanding, but even *that* is something you can train and work on. Don\u0027t ignore your faults or get comfortable being dull.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Doing Good: Three Levels}\n    Type 1 guy: Does someone a favor, then immediately chalks it up like he\u0027s owed something.\n    Type 2 guy: Doesn\u0027t explicitly ask for payback, but internally thinks of himself as a creditor and is very aware of the \u0027good deed\u0027 he did.\n    Type 3 guy: Is almost *unconscious* of having done the good deed. He\u0027s like a grapevine that produces grapes – it just does its thing and asks nothing more once it\u0027s borne its natural fruit. A horse runs, a dog hunts, bees make honey, a good man does good – he doesn\u0027t even realize he\u0027s done it, he just moves on to the next right action, like the vine producing grapes again next season. You should aim to be like Type 3, the ones who act virtuously without even thinking about it. \"Yeah, but,\" someone argues, \"you *should* be aware! It\u0027s part of being social to recognize you\u0027re acting socially, and you should want your neighbor to recognize it too!\" Okay, what you\u0027re saying has a grain of truth, but you\u0027re twisting the real meaning here. If you think like that, you\u0027ll end up like Type 1 or 2, fooled by plausible-sounding but flawed reasoning. If you truly understand the core principle (act virtuously for its own sake), don\u0027t worry – you won\u0027t accidentally stop doing good social acts just because you\u0027re not keeping score.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Pray Simply or Not At All}\n    The Athenians had a prayer: \"Rain, dear Zeus, rain on the fields and plains of Athens.\" That\u0027s how you should pray – simply, directly, freely. Or just don\u0027t pray. No complex bargaining or whining.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Accepting Your \u0027Prescription\u0027 from Nature}\n    We say, \"The doctor (Aesculapius) ordered this guy horse riding, or cold baths, or to go barefoot.\" Similarly, we should say, \"Universal Nature ordered this person sickness, or disability, or loss, or some other difficulty.\" In the doctor example, \u0027ordered\u0027 means \u0027prescribed this as fitting for health.\u0027 In the Nature example, whatever happens to each person has been assigned to them as fitting for the universal order. We talk about things \u0027befitting\u0027 us, just like builders talk about squared stones \u0027fitting\u0027 together in a wall or pyramid, bonding perfectly. The whole universe is one harmonious system. Just as the physical world is made of matter perfectly connected, the chain of causes (Fate/Destiny) is one perfect, connected sequence. Even regular folks get this; they say, \"It was sent to him,\" meaning \"This was ordered/assigned for him.\" So, let\u0027s accept these \u0027orders\u0027 from Nature just like we accept the doctor\u0027s orders. Yeah, many of Nature\u0027s prescriptions are tough, but we welcome them hoping for health. Learn to see the fulfillment of Universal Nature\u0027s plan as *your* pleasure, just like you see following health advice as ultimately good for you. Welcome *everything* that happens, even if it seems harsh, because it leads to the ultimate goal: the health of the whole universe, the well-being of Zeus (the Governing Principle). Nature wouldn\u0027t \u0027send\u0027 something to an individual if it wasn\u0027t also for the good of the whole system – just like any governing principle only dictates what\u0027s appropriate for the thing it governs. Two big reasons to be content with what happens: \\textbf{First}, it happened *for you*, was ordered *for you*, related *to you*, woven into your destiny from the most ancient causes. \\textbf{Second}, what happens to each individual is a *cause* contributing to the welfare, completion, and very continuation of the Governing Principle of the Whole. The whole system gets damaged if you cut even the smallest connection or break the continuity of causes or parts. And you *do* cut it off, as much as you can, whenever you get pissed off and resistant – you\u0027re basically trying to destroy the system.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Fell Down? Get Back Up. Love the Process.}\n    Don\u0027t get disgusted with yourself, don\u0027t quit, don\u0027t get impatient just because you don\u0027t perfectly execute actions based on right principles *every single time*. When you stumble, get back up. Rejoice if *most* of your actions are worthy of a decent human being. Love the philosophy you\u0027re returning to. Don\u0027t go back to it like a kid grudgingly going back to a strict teacher. Go back like someone with sore eyes reaching for the soothing sponge and ointment, or someone applying a comforting poultice or fomentation. See it that way, and you\u0027ll realize obeying Reason isn\u0027t some huge burden; it\u0027s where you find *rest*. Remember: Philosophy only wants what your own nature wants. *You* were the one wanting something else, something out of sync with Nature. Because what\u0027s sweeter than being in sync? Doesn\u0027t pleasure hook us precisely because it\u0027s \u0027sweet\u0027? Well, consider this: aren\u0027t magnanimity, freedom, simplicity, consideration for others, holiness even *sweeter*? And what\u0027s sweeter than Wisdom itself, when you realize the smooth, unbroken flow of understanding and knowledge it brings?\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Reality is Fuzzy, People Suck, Find Rest Inside}\n    Realities are kinda veiled, man. So much so that plenty of smart thinkers (not just randos) thought reality was unknowable. Even the Stoics admit it\u0027s tough to grasp fully. All our perceptions, our \u0027assent\u0027 to things, are shaky and changeable. Where\u0027s the guy who\u0027s never wrong? Doesn\u0027t exist. Okay, shift focus to objects of experience – look how short-lived they are, how cheap, how easily possessed by degenerates, prostitutes, or criminals. Next, consider the characters of the people you live with. Even the best ones are hard to put up with sometimes. Hell, it\u0027s hard enough to put up with *yourself*. In such a fog and muck, in this raging torrent of existence, time, motion, and things moving – what can possibly be worthy of deep respect or serious pursuit? I honestly don\u0027t see it. Instead, you gotta console yourself by patiently waiting for Nature\u0027s release (death), not stressing about the delay. Find peace *only* in two things: \\textbf{One}, nothing will happen to me that isn\u0027t in accordance with the Nature of the Whole Universe. \\textbf{Two}, it is totally within my power *not* to do anything contrary to my own God and inner Spirit (Reason); nobody can force me to violate that.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Whose Soul Are You Using Right Now?}\n    \"What purpose am I using my soul for right now?\" Ask yourself this constantly. Examine: \"What\u0027s going on in this part they call the \u0027governing self\u0027? Whose soul do I currently have active? A child\u0027s? A teenager\u0027s? A woman\u0027s (stereotype alert!)? A tyrant\u0027s? A farm animal\u0027s? A dangerous predator\u0027s?\" Be honest about your current mental state.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{True Goods vs. Fake Goods}\n    You can spot what most people *think* are \u0027goods\u0027 by this test: Imagine someone possessing *real* goods – wisdom, self-control, justice, courage. Could that person seriously listen to that crude popular saying about being so rich you \u0027don\u0027t have a corner to take a shit in\u0027? No way, it wouldn\u0027t fit. But if someone has their mind full of what the *majority* considers goods (wealth, luxury, status symbols), they\u0027ll hear that same saying from a comedian and laugh, thinking it\u0027s totally appropriate. See? Even the average person dimly senses the difference. Otherwise, the saying wouldn\u0027t be offensive in the first case (real goods) but accepted as witty in the second (fake goods). So go ahead, ask yourself: should you really respect and consider things \u0027good\u0027 if, once you possess them, that crude proverb about having no place left to relieve yourself actually seems fitting?\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Eternal Recycling: Form \\\u0026 Matter}\n    I\u0027m made of Form (rational principle) and Matter (physical stuff). Neither of these will vanish into nothing, just like neither came from nothing. So, every part of me will eventually be reassigned by change into some *other* part of the Universe, and that part will change into another, and so on, forever. My parents came into existence through a similar change process, and their parents before them, stretching back infinitely. No reason not to say this, even if the Universe operates in finite cycles of creation and destruction (the changes still happen within or between cycles).\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Reason is Self-Sufficient}\n    Reason, and the process of reasoning, are abilities complete in themselves and their own operations. They start from their own proper foundation (first principles) and proceed towards their intended goal. That\u0027s why rational actions are called *katorthōseis* (right actions) – indicating the \u0027rightness\u0027 or \u0027straightness\u0027 of their path.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Only Human Goods Matter}\n    A person shouldn\u0027t treasure any of those things that don\u0027t belong to a human being *as a human being*. They aren\u0027t requirements of our nature, our nature doesn\u0027t promise them, and they aren\u0027t completions or perfections of human nature. Therefore, our ultimate purpose (end/telos) doesn\u0027t lie in them, and certainly not the \u0027good\u0027 that fulfills that purpose. Besides, if any of those external things (wealth, fame, etc.) were truly part of our essential portion, it wouldn\u0027t make sense for us to disdain them or resist them. The person who achieves independence from them wouldn\u0027t be praiseworthy, and the person who deliberately takes less wouldn\u0027t be considered good, if they were *really* \u0027Goods\u0027. But as things actually are, the more a man strips himself of these things, or bears it patiently when they\u0027re taken from him, the *better* a person he is.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Your Mind is Dyed by Your Thoughts}\n    Whatever you repeatedly imagine, that\u0027s what your mind will become, because the soul takes on the color of its thoughts. So, dye your soul by constantly soaking it in thoughts like these: For instance, \"Where it\u0027s possible to live, it\u0027s also possible to live *well*.\" \"But it\u0027s possible to live in a palace.\" \"Therefore, it\u0027s possible to live *well* in a palace.\" Or again: \"A creature is made *for* the sake of that purpose for which it was created.\" \"And whatever it was made for, that\u0027s what it naturally moves *towards*.\" \"And what it moves towards, that\u0027s its ultimate *end*.\" \"And where its end is, that\u0027s where its advantage and *good* lie.\" \"Therefore, fellowship (community, social cooperation) is the good of a rational creature.\" We proved long ago we\u0027re born for fellowship, right? Wasn\u0027t it obvious that inferior creatures exist for the sake of superior ones, and superior ones exist for each other? But animate beings are superior to inanimate, and rational beings are superior to merely animate ones.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Chasing the Impossible is Nuts}\n    Trying to achieve the impossible is madness. But it *is* impossible for bad people *not* to do the kind of bad things they do. Expecting otherwise is the madness.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{What Doesn\u0027t Break Others Shouldn\u0027t Break You}\n    Nothing happens to anything which that thing isn\u0027t naturally equipped to bear. The same challenging experience happens to someone else, and they stay calm and unharmed – either because they don\u0027t realize its \u0027severity\u0027 or because they show great character (greatness of soul). Isn\u0027t it weird if ignorance and simple acceptance turn out to be stronger than wisdom? (Think about that.)\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Things Don\u0027t Touch the Soul}\n    External things, as such, don\u0027t touch the soul at all. They can\u0027t get access to it, can\u0027t turn it, can\u0027t move it. The soul *alone* turns and moves itself. And it makes whatever external data it receives conform to the judgments it deems itself worthy of.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{People: Help \u0027Em, Endure \u0027Em, Work Around \u0027Em}\n    In one sense, other people are the closest things to us – we *must* do them good and tolerate them. But, insofar as they become obstacles to my specific duties or actions, they become as indifferent to me as the sun, the wind, or a wild animal. Yes, these things might *hinder* a specific action, but they can\u0027t hinder my underlying *impulse* and *disposition*, because I have the power of \u0027reservation\u0027 (Plan B thinking) and \u0027adaptation\u0027. My understanding can adapt and reshape any obstacle to serve its purpose. A hindrance to a specific task can become a *help* (by testing virtue), an obstacle on one path can become a *furtherance* (by forcing a better path).\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Respect the Boss (Universal \\\u0026 Internal)}\n    Revere the ultimate power in the Universe – the thing that uses all and directs all. Likewise, revere the governing power *in yourself*. It\u0027s the same kind of power. Because in you too, this is the faculty that uses everything else, and your way of living is directed by it.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{City Not Harmed? Citizen Not Harmed.}\n    Whenever you imagine you\u0027ve been injured, apply this rule: \"If the community (city/polis) isn\u0027t harmed by this, then neither am I truly injured.\" But if the community *is* harmed, don\u0027t just get angry. Calmly point out to the person causing the harm what they\u0027ve failed to see (their error).\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Everything Flows Away}\n    Repeatedly reflect on how fast things that *are* pass by and depart, and how fast things that *come to be* also pass by. Substance is like a constantly flowing river. Actions are in continuous change. Causes have infinite variations. Hardly anything stands still, even what seems close. Think also about the infinite abyss of past and future time, where everything vanishes. So, isn\u0027t he a fool who gets puffed up, stressed out, or complains bitterly about things in this fleeting reality, as if he were stuck in some long-lasting, troublesome situation?\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Your Tiny Slice of Everything}\n    Call to mind the entirety of Substance (all matter/existence), of which you possess a tiny fragment. Call to mind the entirety of Time, of which a brief, measured span has been assigned to you. Call to mind the Chain of Causation (Fate/Destiny), of which you are just one small link.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{He Screws Up? His Problem.}\n    Someone else does wrong. What\u0027s that to me? Let him worry about it. He has his own disposition, his own actions. I have right *now* what Universal Nature wills me to have, and I am doing right *now* what my own nature wills me to do.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Mind Over Matter (Literally)}\n    Make sure the governing, sovereign part of your soul isn\u0027t diverted by the sensations (smooth or rough) happening in your flesh. Don\u0027t let your mind blend with those sensations. Keep itself separate, limit those feelings to the bodily parts. But when those sensations *do* inevitably get communicated to the understanding (because body and mind are linked), don\u0027t try to *resist* the sensation itself (it\u0027s natural). However, the governing part must *not* add its own judgment that the sensation is inherently \u0027good\u0027 or \u0027bad\u0027.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Live With the Gods (By Living Right)}\n    \"Live with the gods.\" How? By constantly showing them your soul is satisfied with its assigned lot and is doing what the *daimon* (the inner deity, the fragment of Zeus given to guide each person) wills. And that *daimon* is each person\u0027s own Mind and Reason.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Dealing With Stinky People (Literally \\\u0026 Figuratively)}\n    Are you pissed off at the guy who has bad breath or body odor? What good will getting angry do? He has a foul mouth, foul armpits – it\u0027s a necessary consequence of certain causes. \"Okay, but the guy has reason! If he thought about it, he could understand why he\u0027s offensive!\" Bless your heart! And *you* have reason too! Let your rational disposition engage *his* rational disposition. Point it out, remind him gently. If he listens, you\u0027ll cure the issue, and anger becomes pointless. You\u0027re not here to be a drama queen or a prostitute (reacting emotionally for effect or gain).\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Live Right Here, Or Leave Calmly}\n    The way you intend to live when you eventually \u0027depart\u0027 (die)? That\u0027s how you *can* live right here, right now. If circumstances (or people) genuinely don\u0027t allow you to live according to your principles? Fine, then exit life. But do it calmly, as if you\u0027re suffering no great evil. \"The chimney\u0027s smoking, so I leave the room.\" Why make a huge drama out of it? But as long as no such compelling reason forces me out, I remain a free citizen here, and nobody can stop me from acting as I will. And I will what aligns with the nature of a rational and social creature.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{The Universe is Social}\n    The Mind of the Whole is inherently social. It definitely made inferior things for the sake of superior things, and it connected the superior things to each other. See how it has subordinated, coordinated, assigned each thing its proper due, and brought the ruling creatures (rational beings) into agreement with each other?\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Life Review: How\u0027d You Do?}\n    How have you conducted yourself so far towards: gods, parents, siblings, spouse, children, bosses, teachers, friends, relatives, servants? Has your track record with everyone up till now basically been: \"Never intentionally harmed anyone or said anything unjust\"? Remind yourself what kinds of challenges you\u0027ve been through and what you\u0027ve had the strength to endure. Realize that the story of your life is already largely written, your service mostly rendered. How many beautiful things have you witnessed? How many pleasures and pains have you looked down upon (mastered)? How many ambitions have you ignored? How many unkind people have you treated with kindness?\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Who Truly Knows?}\n    Why do ignorant and unlearned people confuse men of real knowledge and learning? What kind of soul *has* knowledge and learning? The soul that knows the beginning and the end, and understands the Reason (Logos) that permeates all substance and governs the entire Universe through all eternity according to fixed cycles.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Ashes, Echoes, and What Matters}\n    In such a short time: ashes or a skeleton. Maybe a name, maybe not even that. If a name, just a sound, an echo. Everything prized in life? Empty, rotten, petty. Like puppies snapping at each other. Like little kids quarreling, laughing one minute, crying the next. And Faith, Self-Respect, Justice, and Truth? They\u0027ve \u0027\"fled to Olympus from the spacious earth.\"\u0027 (Quoting Hesiod). So, what\u0027s left to keep you here? The physical world is constantly changing, never stable. Your senses are blurry, easily deceived. The soul itself is just an exhalation from blood. And a good reputation in these conditions? Vanity. What then? Wait peacefully – either for extinction or for transformation. Until that time comes, what\u0027s sufficient? What else but to worship and bless the gods, do good to fellow humans, bear with them patiently, and practice self-restraint? And as for everything that lies within the limits of mere flesh and breath – remember it\u0027s not truly yours and not in your ultimate control.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Favorable Tides Through Right Action}\n    You can *always* have a favorable tide (good fortune) if you can take the right path – that is, if you can consistently conceive thoughts and perform actions with rectitude (correctness/justice). Two things are common to the soul of God and the soul of man (and every rational creature): 1) Not being hindered by anything external (in terms of inner freedom). 2) Finding one\u0027s good in righteous disposition and action, and limiting one\u0027s desire to achieving that.\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Is the Universe Harmed?}\n    If this event isn\u0027t an evil *caused by me* or an action *resulting from my own evil*, and if the Universe as a whole isn\u0027t injured by it, then why am I troubled? And what injury *is* there to the Universe anyway? (Hint: None that affects its fundamental nature).\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Help Appropriately, Don\u0027t Catch the Drama}\n    Don\u0027t get swept away by surface appearances (imagination). Help people as best you can and as they deserve, even if their loss is just about \u0027indifferent\u0027 things (money, status, possessions). However, *do not* internalize the idea that this loss is a real *injury* to them (or you). That habit of thinking is bad. Be like the old man in the story: when he left, he\u0027d ask for his foster child\u0027s toy top back, but he never forgot it was *just a toy top*. Act like that here too. So, you\u0027re up there lamenting dramatically (like on a stage)? Friend, have you forgotten what these external things are truly worth? \"I know,\" someone says, \"but they meant so much *to them*!\" Is *that* a reason for *you* to make a fool of yourself too by adopting their flawed judgment?\n\n    \\item \\textbf{Defining Good Fortune}\n    Someone says, \"There was a time I was Fortune\u0027s favorite, wherever she went, I benefited!\" Yeah, okay. But being \u0027Fortune\u0027s favorite\u0027 properly means *assigning good fortune to yourself*. And real good fortune means: good inner dispositions, good impulses (motivations), and good actions. That\u0027s it. That\u0027s true luck, and it\u0027s self-generated.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n**Explanation of LaTeX commands used:**\n\n*   `\\documentclass{article}`: Specifies the basic document type.\n*   `\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}`: Allows you to type accented and special characters directly.\n*   `\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}`: Selects font encoding for better character support and hyphenation.\n*   `\\usepackage{geometry}`: Used here to set 1-inch margins on A4 paper.\n*   `\\usepackage{times}`: Sets the main font to Times New Roman (or a close equivalent).\n*   `\\title{...}`, `\\author{...}`, `\\date{\\today}`: Define the title block information.\n*   `\\begin{document}`...`\\end{document}`: Encloses the main content of the document.\n*   `\\maketitle`: Displays the title block.\n*   `\\section*{...}`: Creates an unnumbered section heading (used for Book titles).\n*   `\\begin{enumerate}`...`\\end{enumerate}`: Creates a numbered list for the points within each book.\n*   `\\item`: Denotes each item within the `enumerate` list.\n*   `\\textbf{...}`: Makes text bold (used for the short summaries at the start of each point).\n*   `\\textit{...}`: Makes text italic (used for location notes or emphasis).\n*   `\\begin{itemize}`...`\\end{itemize}`: Creates a bulleted list (used in Book 2, Item 9).\n*   `\\\\`: Creates a line break (used in Book 1, Item 17 for the location note).\n*   `\\newpage`: Forces a page break before the next book starts.\n\nCompile this code, and you should get a nicely formatted PDF of the first five books of the \"Bro Version\" Meditations.",
