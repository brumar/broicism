# BROICISM: Stoic Wisdom, Remixed

Yo Bro, welcome to the spot where ancient wisdom gets a modern voice. We took some heavy-hitting Stoic texts and got the AI to translate them into something straightforward, actionable, and maybe even a little funnier.

Think of it like this: same solid principles, less dusty language.

**First Timer? Hit the Audio!**
We highly recommend starting with the **NotebookLM Deep Dives** (`.wav` files). These are AI-generated audio discussions that break down the core ideas of each section. It's a killer way to get the gist before diving into the text.

## The Main Event: Epictetus' Enchiridion - Bro Edition (52 Rules)

This is the core of BROICISM. Epictetus was a beast â€“ former slave turned legendary teacher. His *Enchiridion* (or "Handbook") is pure, concentrated advice on how to live a solid, resilient life. No fluff.

We broke it down into 52 rules, bro-style.

*   **Listen First (Recommended):** NotebookLM Deep Dive [`enchiridion/notebooklm_podcast_deep_dive.wav`](./enchiridion/notebooklm_podcast_deep_dive.wav)
*   **Read the Rules:** [`enchiridion/bro_enchiridion_52_rules.md`](./enchiridion/bro_enchiridion_52_rules.md)
*   **Grab the PDF:** [`enchiridion/bro_enchiridion_52_rules.pdf`](./enchiridion/bro_enchiridion_52_rules.pdf)

## Bonus Round: Marcus Aurelius' Meditations - Bro Edition

Next up, meet Marcus Aurelius. Roman Emperor, absolute unit, and a dude who wrote down his personal thoughts on handling power, pressure, and life's BS. These weren't meant for us, but damn, are they useful.

This section contains the ongoing "Bro" translation of his *Meditations*.

*   **Get the Intro:** [`meditations/README.md`](./meditations/README.md) (More details on the Meditations section)
