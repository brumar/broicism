# Not much too say

I just wanted to see if Gemini2.5 Pro could do a more bro-friendly of a book I like.

The book is the enchiridion from epictetus.

I used this translation: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/45109/45109-h/45109-h.htm

The full history of the conversation with the Gemini is in the repository.

Overleaf has been used to produce the pdf and https://pandoc.org/try/ for the markdown in the Readme.
